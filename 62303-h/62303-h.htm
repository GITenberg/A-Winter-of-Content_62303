<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">small</span>, rocky island in a lake, a
canoe paddling away across the blue water, a woman standing on a
narrow strip of beach, looking after it.&nbsp; I was the woman
left on the shore, the canoe held my companions of the past
summer, the island was to be my home until another summer should
bring them back again.</p>
<p>There is no denying that I was frightened as I turned back
along the trail toward the little house among the birches.&nbsp;
It was hard work to keep from jumping into a boat and putting out
after the canoe that was rounding the point and leaving me
alone.</p>
<p>Little chilly fears laid icy fingers on the back of my
neck.&nbsp; A shadow slipped between the trees; a sigh whispered
among the leaves.&nbsp; I wanted to see all round me; I wanted to
put my back against a wall.&nbsp; A little, grinning goblin of a
misgiving stuck out an impudent tongue as it quoted some of the
jeers of unsympathetic friends and relatives, who had derided my
plan for borrowing the camp, <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>when summer was gone, and staying on
alone at the Lake of Many Islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; had smiled my sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
say you mean to stay a year, but you&rsquo;ll tire of solitude
long before the winter.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see you back at
Thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only mid-September, but I wanted to see her then at
that very instant.</p>
<p>There had been a farewell dinner, the family assembled, to
prophesy disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll freeze your nose and ears off,&rdquo;
mourned a reassuring aunt.</p>
<p>In vain I reminded her that no inhabitant seen in five
summers&rsquo; sojourn at the lake had been without a nose or
ears; all had had the requisite number of features, although some
of those same features had withstood the cold of well-nigh a
hundred winters.&nbsp; But she was not consoled, and continued to
regard me so tearfully that I felt sure that she was bidding
farewell to my nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break a leg and lie for days before anyone
knows you are hurt,&rdquo; said Cousin John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be snowed in and no one will find you
until spring,&rdquo; said Brother Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a city woman and not strong.&nbsp; <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>What do you
know of a pioneer&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; It is the most foolish plan
we ever heard of,&rdquo; chorused all.</p>
<p>Descending from prophecy to argument, they continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will have a telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will not,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
been jerked at the end of a telephone wire for years.&nbsp; I
want rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you will have a good dog.&nbsp; That will be
some protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dog would drive away all the wild things.&nbsp; I
want to study them,&rdquo; I objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, find some other woman to
stay there with you.&nbsp; Surely there is another lunatic
willing to freeze to death on the precious island.&nbsp; You
should have a companion, if only to send for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a companion,&rdquo; I protested,
tearfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be responsible for another
person&rsquo;s comfort or safety.&nbsp; I will do this thing
alone or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired to death,&rdquo; I stormed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
need rest for at least one year.&nbsp; I want to watch the
procession of the seasons in some place that is not all paved
streets, city smells and noise.&nbsp; Instead of the clang of car
bells and <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>the honk of automobile horns, I want to hear the winds
sing across the ice fields, instead of the smell of asphalt and
hot gasoline, I want the odor of wet earth in boggy places.&nbsp;
I have loved the woods all my life, I long to see the year go
round there just once before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which outburst they shrugged exasperated shoulders and were
silent, but each one drew me aside, at parting, and pressed a
gift into my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to let us know if anything goes wrong.&nbsp;
Write to us if you need the least thing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
ashamed to come back, if the experiment proves a
failure&rdquo;&mdash;and so on and so on, God bless them!</p>
<p>Of all this the bogy reminded me as he danced ahead up the
winding trail.</p>
<p>The house looked lonely, even in the brightness of the late
afternoon.&nbsp; I hurried supper, to be indoors before the
twilight fell.&nbsp; Big Canadian hares hopped along the paths
and sat at the kitchen door, their great eyes peering, long,
furry ears alert, quivering noses pressed against the wire
screen.&nbsp; Grouse pecked on the hill side, as tame as barnyard
fowl.&nbsp; From the water came the evening call of the
loons.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The
scant meal finished, I ran across the platform from the kitchen
to the main house and locked up.&nbsp; Somehow, I did not want
any open doors behind me that evening.&nbsp; Then I loaded the
pistol and laid it on a shelf at the head of the bed, along with
the Bible and the Prayer Book.&nbsp; If any marauder could know
how dreadfully afraid I am of that pistol, he would do his
marauding with a quiet mind.&nbsp; I never expect to touch that
weapon.&nbsp; It shall be cleaned and oiled when any of the men
come over from the mainland, but handle it&mdash;never!&nbsp; I
would not fire it for a kingdom.</p>
<p>While it was still light I climbed into bed, and lay down
rigid, with tight-shut eyes, trying to pretend I did not hear all
the rustling, creaking, snapping noises in the woods.&nbsp; Heavy
animals pushed through the fallen leaves.&nbsp; Something that
sounded as large as a moose went crashing through the dry
bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rabbit,&rdquo; I whispered to myself.</p>
<p>Creatures surely as large as bears rushed through the
underbrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grouse,&rdquo; I tried to believe.</p>
<p>From the lake came stealthy sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Driftwood pounding against the rocks, not <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>really
oars,&rdquo; I murmured to my thumping heart.</p>
<p>Then light, pattering footsteps on the porch.</p>
<p>In desperation I raised my head and looked out.&nbsp; It was a
little red fox, trotting busily along, snuffling softly as he
went.&nbsp; I lay down and closed my eyes firmly, determined not
to open them again no matter what might happen, then must have
dozed, for, suddenly I was aware of a light that flooded all the
room.</p>
<p>There through the northeast window, large and round and
beautiful, shone the moon, the great Moon of the Falling
Leaves.&nbsp; It was like the sudden meeting with a friend,
reassuring, comforting.&nbsp; A broad band of light lay across my
breast like a kind arm thrown over me.&nbsp; The path of the
moonbeams on the water seemed the road to some safe haven.&nbsp;
With the moon&rsquo;s calm face looking in and the soft lapping
of the waves as lullaby, I fell asleep&mdash;and lo! it was
day.</p>
<p>This house, the living room of the camp, that is to be my home
for the coming winter, stands on a bluff overhanging the
lake.&nbsp; It is a one-room shack, 16&times;20 feet, surrounded
by an eight-foot porch.&nbsp; It is one-storied, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>shingled, the
porch roof upheld by birch log pillars, beautiful still clothed
in their silvery bark.&nbsp; There are eight windows, two in each
corner, and through some of them the sun is always shining.</p>
<p>Adjoining this main shack and connected with it by an
uncovered platform are the kitchen and storeroom, but these will
not be used in winter.&nbsp; The stores and I will have to stay
in the big house if we are not to freeze.</p>
<p>From these buildings little trails run off through the woods
to the dock, the pump, the summer sleeping shacks, and a path
goes all round the island close to the shore.&nbsp; Away from
these beaten tracks are all sorts of hidden nooks and lovely, dim
seclusions.</p>
<p>This little rocky island, one of scores that dot the face of
the lake, is all a tangle of ferns and vines and
wildflowers.&nbsp; It is thickly wooded with white birch, poplar
and wild cherry.&nbsp; There are also oaks, maples, pines, and
great clumps of basswood, and innumerable little cedars are
pushing up everywhere.</p>
<p>Making a way through the overgrown paths in the early morning,
I break through myriads of spiderwebs, stretched across from
bushes heavy with dew.&nbsp; They feel like the <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>tiniest of
fairy fingers brushing my cheek, and laid on my eyelids, light as
the memory of a caress.&nbsp; Butterflies dressed in black
velvet, with white satin frills and sapphire jewels, flutter on
ahead, and the stems of the birches are seen through a gold-green
glow, like sunlight shining through clear water.&nbsp; When I sit
on the sandy bottom, with the whole lake for my washpot, small
fishes, wearing coral buttons and jade green ruffles on fins and
tails, bump their blunt noses against my knees.</p>
<p>Sounds from the mainland come across the lake, blurred and
indistinct.&nbsp; On the island I hear only the wind in the
trees, the water beating against the stones, and the hum of many
insect wings.</p>
<p>There is something queer about the island.&nbsp; I am
convinced that it stands on some magnetic pole or other, that
puts every clock and watch out of order as soon as it is landed
here.&nbsp; Cheap or fine, every timepiece breaks a mainspring,
and then we fall back on the sundial to tell us what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We can always know when it is noon, provided
the weather be sunny.&nbsp; When it is cloudy we guess at the
time and wait for the next fine day.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>This
sundial stands in a clearing beside the house, and bears for its
motto, not the high-sounding Latin quotation that seems to belong
to sundials, but the trite assertion, &ldquo;Time is
valuable.&rdquo;&nbsp; A statement wholly untrue, so far as this
present life of mine is concerned.&nbsp; A fine bass, now, or a
tin of beans perhaps is valuable, but surely not time, in a place
where there is nothing to do but eat, sleep, and think.</p>
<p>Yet when I stood to-day, on this lonely bit of land, in the
midst of an empty lake, waiting for the shadow to travel to the
mark, I seemed to catch, for one fleeting instant, some idea of
the terrible, inexorable passing of the hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set thy house in order, set thy house in order,&rdquo;
something seemed to say, &ldquo;for never, for thee, shall the
shadow turn back upon the dial.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that moment I
stood alone in space, on this old clock the earth, swinging with
the whirling of the spheres.</p>
<p>The lake too has its mystery, a strange light that shines from
the point of one of the islands.&nbsp; No one lives on that land;
there is no farmhouse near it on the shore, nor is it in line
with any dwelling whose light could seem to glimmer from its
point.&nbsp; The flare is too <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>high and too steady for fox-fire, the
glow that comes from rotting wood, and though men say they have
explored the place repeatedly, there has never been any sign of a
campfire there.&nbsp; But every now and again that light shines
by night, like a beacon, and no one has ever explained it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the phantom of the council fire, round which the
red warriors sat in the days when this land was theirs.&nbsp; For
there were Indians hereabout, and not so very long ago; and
people on the mainland tell of a great fight that raged here when
a band of the Mississagua Nation, led by the chief White Eagle,
fought with an invading war party and of a day of battle from
dawn until the going down of the sun when the lake was red with
blood.&nbsp; On the sheer face of the cliff of the opposite
island are red veinings in the rock.&nbsp; If one pretends very
hard, they are pictures of two war canoes left there by some
artist of the tribe.&nbsp; The people here believe in them
devoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were painted in blood,&rdquo; they say.</p>
<p>A very indelible blood it must have been, for those tracings
have withstood the wash of high water for many a year.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Whether
the picture writing is genuine or no, there is plenty of evidence
that Indians lived along the shores of Many Islands, and there is
a pretty story told of the wedding of a girl, White Eagle&rsquo;s
daughter, to a young brave of her tribe.&nbsp; The Indians came
down the lakes and through the portages to Queensport, in their
fine canoes, and the lovers were married there by the priest at
the mission.&nbsp; Afterward they were all entertained at dinner
by the big-hearted wife of the principal merchant of the
town.&nbsp; That lady&rsquo;s daughter tells me that for many
seasons thereafter the chief&rsquo;s daughter would bring or send
beautiful birch baskets, filled with berries or maple sugar for
the children of her hostess.</p>
<p>The bride is described as slim and young, with big, dark
eyes.&nbsp; The wedding dress was dark blue cloth, trimmed with
new-minted five- and ten-cent pieces, pierced and sewed on in a
pattern&mdash;this worn over a vest of buckskin, beautifully
embroidered.</p>
<p>What became of you, little Indian Bride, girl of the grateful
heart?&nbsp; Were you happy here at Many Islands, or was it
life-blood of your brave that helped to redden all the
waters?&nbsp; Did you move back and back with <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>your
wandering people, or are you lying under the cedars on some green
slope of the shore?&nbsp; I shall never know, but I shall think
of you and wonder.</p>
<p>There are no Indians here now, except one old squaw, who lives
far back on the road to Maskinonge and tans buckskins in the fine
old Indian way, but the plow turns up the arrowheads, and once in
a while a bowl or pipe, proofs that the red men lived and fought
here.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lake of the Many Islands, long,
irregular, spring-fed, lies in a cup of the rolling Ontario
farmlands.&nbsp; At the south its waters, passing through a
narrow strait, widen into beautiful Blue Bay.&nbsp; At the north
they empty, in a series of cascades, into the little river Eau
Claire.&nbsp; The town of Les Rapides, its sawmill idle, the ten
or twelve log houses closed, stands at the outlet, a deserted
village.&nbsp; The eagles soar to and fro over the blue lake; the
black bass jump; the dor&eacute; swim.&nbsp; There are hundreds
of little coves and narrow channels&mdash;waters forgotten of the
foot, where only the hum of insect wings and the rattle of the
kingfisher are heard, and where the heron stands sentinel in the
marshes and the loons have their mud nests on the shores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy as a loon,&rdquo; that is, of all phrases, the
most libelous.&nbsp; For the loon is the most sensible of fowl
and possessed of the most distinct personality.&nbsp; No other
water bird has so direct and so level a flight.&nbsp; He lays his
strong body down along the wind, and goes, like a bullet,
straight to his goal, purposeful, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>unswerving.&nbsp; He has three cries,
one a high, maniac laugh, which is, of course, the reason his
wits are slandered; then a loud, squealing cry, very like the
sound of a pig in distress; and last a long, yearning call, the
summons to his mate, perhaps, that he sends out far across the
water&mdash;a cry that seems the very voice of the
wilderness.&nbsp; At twilight, and often in the night, I hear
that lonely cry, echoing down the lakes, and the faint, far cry
that answers it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be wind to-night,&rdquo; the weather-wise
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear the loons making a noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birds come to the bay back of the island, and swim about
there as friendly as puddle ducks.&nbsp; If I go too close,
closer than Mr. Gavia Immer thinks safe or respectful, down he
goes and stays for some minutes under the water, to emerge far
away, and in quite a different quarter from the one in which I
expected to see him.&nbsp; No one on earth could ever predict
where a loon will come up when he dives.&nbsp; He looks at me
austerely, twisting his black head back on his shoulder, until I
would swear he had turned it completely round on his white-ringed
neck.&nbsp; Then he gives his crazy laugh and disappears
again.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
loon is protected in Canada.&nbsp; No one may shoot him or molest
him.&nbsp; But once in a while one comes across a boat cushion
made of a bird skin, its gray and white feathers very soft and
thick and attached to the skin so fast that it is well-nigh
impossible to pluck them.&nbsp; That is the breast of the loon,
the great wild bird of the northern lakes, that the game law has
failed to save.&nbsp; When I see one of these skins I hate the
vandal who has killed the bird.</p>
<p>The Blakes are my nearest neighbors&mdash;not nearest
geographically, for the Drapeau farm lies closer to the island;
but near by reason of their many friendly acts and kind
suggestions.&nbsp; If I am ill or in trouble, it is to Henry and
Mary Blake that I shall go for help.</p>
<p>Henry Blake of the keen, ice-blue eye, the caustic tongue and
the good heart.&nbsp; There was never anything more scathing than
his condemnation of the shiftlessness and, what he considers the
general imbecility of his neighbors, and never anything kinder
than his willingness to help one of them in a crisis.&nbsp; He
will sit for an hour, pencil in hand, laboring to explain to some
unsuccessful farmer that wood hauled at next to nothing a cord
can <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>only
land the hauler in a ditch of debt, and when the hapless one has
departed, fully determined to go his own way, to hear Henry spit
out the one word, &ldquo;Fat-head,&rdquo; as he turns back to his
book, is a lesson in the nice choice of epithet.</p>
<p>When it comes to judgment on the manners, the morals, and the
methods of their neighbors Henry and Mary Blake sit in the seats
of the scornful; but, after all, they are somewhat justified, for
they came over from &ldquo;The States.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry, an
invalid, bought a rundown island farm, and they have brought it
to a good state of cultivation and paid off their mortgage, all
in ten years.</p>
<p>But while they are free in their criticisms of the natives,
who live from hand to mouth, one notices that the Blakes are
always willing to do a good turn, and are usually being asked to
do one.&nbsp; Is a house to be built?&nbsp; Henry is called on to
plan it.&nbsp; Does a churn spring a leak, or a cow fall
ill?&nbsp; Mary goes to the rescue.&nbsp; Does a temperamental
seed-drill choke in one of its sixty odd pipes?&nbsp; Henry is
sent for to find the seat of the disorder and to apply the
remedy.</p>
<p>I also went to him, when deliberating the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>relative cost
of a log house and one of board.&nbsp; Mr. Blake discussed the
matter with me in the kindest way, summing up his advice in a
sentence, that reached my muddled brain in some such statement as
the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all comes to this.&nbsp; You can get one cedar log,
6&times;14 for twenty cents.&nbsp; Three goes into twenty-one
seven times, so board or log, it would come to the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t what he said, of course, but I hastened to
agree, lest I should be a fat-head too.</p>
<p>Everything on the Blake farm is a pet, from the handsome young
Jersey bull, to the tiniest chick, hatched untimely from a
nest-egg.&nbsp; They all run toward Mary as soon as she steps
from the kitchen door, and as she hurries from house to barn
there is always a rabble of small ducks, chickens, calves, and
kittens hurrying after her.&nbsp; The other day, when she, Henry,
and Jimmy Dodd, their adopted boy, set off for a tour of the
lake, a calf swam after them, and tried so earnestly to climb
aboard that, perforce, they turned back to shore and tied the
foolish creature, lest he should drown himself and them.</p>
<p>Like almost every family in the <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>countryside, the Blakes have adopted
a small boy, giving him a home and training and enough to eat,
which he never had before in all his forlorn life.&nbsp; They are
kindness itself to Jimmie, but Henry regards him with the same
foreboding he feels for all other native-born Canadians.&nbsp; He
trains him, but in the spirit of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie here,&rdquo; he philosophizes, &ldquo;he
can&rsquo;t seem to learn the first thing; and if he learns it,
he can&rsquo;t retain it.&nbsp; I have taught him to read, but he
can&rsquo;t remember a word; and to write, but he forgets it the
next day.&nbsp; Mary even put him through the catechism, and a
week later he didn&rsquo;t know one thing about it.&nbsp; So what
are you going to do?&nbsp; I figure out,&rdquo; he goes on
meditatively, &ldquo;that the people who learn easy are the ones
who have been here before.&nbsp; They knew it all in another
life, maybe in another language, and all they have to do is just
to recall it.&nbsp; But Jimmie here&mdash;well, I guess this is
his first trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the while Jimmie of the towhead and the thin, wiry legs
and arms is grinning at his critic with a wide, snaggle-toothed
smile of great affection.</p>
<p>The Blakes&rsquo; house stands on the site of an <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>old log hut,
of two rooms and a lean-to shed.&nbsp; In digging the cellar they
came upon a walled-in grave&mdash;the boards almost rotted
away&mdash;and in it lay a skeleton.&nbsp; Whose?&nbsp; No one
knows, for that grave was dug before the time of anyone now
living at Many Islands.&nbsp; Was it some Indian warrior laid
there to sleep?&nbsp; Was it a settler of the old pioneer
days?&nbsp; No one can tell and no one cares.&nbsp; The Blakes
built their comfortable eight-room house over his bones and
thought no more about them.</p>
<p>Yesterday Mary and I drove to Queensport, the county seat,
fifteen miles away, that I might show myself at the bank and the
stores where I am to trade this winter.&nbsp; The start was to be
early, and I rose at dawn to have breakfast over, the cabin
cleaned, and I myself rowed over to the farm.&nbsp; The woods lay
wrapped in a heavy mist.&nbsp; Not a wet leaf stirred.&nbsp; The
water looked like mouse-colored cr&ecirc;pe, and the sun hung
like a big, pink balloon in a sky of gray velvet.&nbsp; But
before our start the mists had burned away and the day was
glorious.</p>
<p>The road lies through a rolling country, all hills, woods,
lakes, and glades.&nbsp; Queensport <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>stands at the head of a chain of
lakes.&nbsp; It boasts two banks, a high school, churches of all
denominations, and a dozen or so shops and houses set in
gardens.&nbsp; We dined at the hotel, the Wardrobe House; we
transacted our business at the bank, and turned then to our
shopping.&nbsp; We went to the harness shop for bread, to the
grocer&rsquo;s for a spool of thread, to the tailor&rsquo;s to
enquire the cost of a telephone.&nbsp; Then I bethought me of my
need for some rag carpet.&nbsp; I did not really want that carpet
that day, indeed, I had not the money to pay for it.&nbsp; I only
thought of inquiring for it while I was in the town.</p>
<p>We were directed to the hardware shop as the most likely place
for carpets, and I had no sooner mentioned my errand when a voice
came out from behind a stove saying eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where you can find just what you&rsquo;re
looking for.&nbsp; My old mother has forty yards of as fine a rag
carpet as you could wish to see.&nbsp; Say the word and
I&rsquo;ll drive you right out to the farm and show it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon a tall, wiry, keen-faced man rose up and dashed out
of the shop, returning in an instant with a buggy and a
wild-looking black horse.&nbsp; Despite my protests we were <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>bundled into
the vehicle and driven at a gallop, through the main street of
Queensport, and the driving was as the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi.&nbsp; Past farms and fields we flew, stopping with a
mighty jerk at the door of the mother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; There
the carpet was rolled forth before me, and there Mary Blake and
our energetic friend measured me off twenty yards of it, by a
nick in the edge of the kitchen table.</p>
<p>In vain I pleaded and explained my poverty.&nbsp; Our abductor
waved me a careless hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; he assured us, &ldquo;is the last thing
that ever worried me.&nbsp; You may pay for the carpet when and
where you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way back to town my new friend was properly
presented.&nbsp; His name was William Whitfield.&nbsp; Later I
heard varied tales of his peculiarities.&nbsp; There was talk of
a horse trade, to which Bill Whitfield was a party.&nbsp; The
other man came out of the transaction the richer by one more
experience, but the poorer as regarded property.&nbsp; It was
told me that men said freely that Bill Whitfield drunk could get
the better of any two sober men in the Dominion when it came to a
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>bargain,
and, as I contemplated my roll of carpet, leaning against the
dashboard, I understood why I had been as wax in his hands, and I
could only be thankful that it had not occurred to Mr. Whitfield
to sell me the whole forty yards.</p>
<p>Back we jogged, Mary and I, along the quiet roads, discussing
our bargains and the news of the town.&nbsp; We passed the
schoolhouse just as &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; was locking the door
for the night.&nbsp; The dusty road was printed all over with the
marks of little bare feet, all turning away from the school gate
and pointing toward home.&nbsp; The sun was sinking in a flaming
sky as we came to the shore of our own lake, where the rowboat
lay on the sand awaiting us, a pair of tired travelers, glad to
be nearing home.</p>
<p>I would not be a bigot.&nbsp; To each man should belong the
right to vaunt the glories of his own beloved camping
ground.&nbsp; There may be other places as beautiful as this Lake
of the Many Islands, although I cannot believe it.&nbsp; But Many
Islands at sunset, its quiet waters all rose and saffron and
lavender, under a crescent moon; when the swallows skim the
surface and dip their breasts in the ripple, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and the blue
heron flaps away to his nest in the reeds&mdash;Well!&nbsp; I
shall see no other spot that so moves my heart with its beauty,
until my eyes look out beyond the sunset and behold the land that
is very far off.</p>
<p>I drift on past the islands, where the cedars troop down to
the water&rsquo;s edge, and the white birches lean far out over
the rocks.&nbsp; The colors fade, the far line of the forests
becomes a purple blur, and stars come out and hang in a dove-gray
sky.&nbsp; I land at the little dock, safe hidden in the cove; I
scramble along the dark trail to the house, while the loons are
laughing and calling as they rock on the waves.</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days are still warm, but autumn
is surely here.&nbsp; The wasps are dying everywhere and lie in
heaps on all the window-sills; the great water spiders have
disappeared, and all day long the yellow leaves drift down
silently, steadily, in the forests.&nbsp; Wreaths of vapor hang
over the trees, and every wind brings the pungent fall odor of
distant forest fires.&nbsp; The hillsides are a blaze of color,
with basswoods a beautiful butter-yellow, oaks, russet and maroon
and sugar maples, a flame of scarlet against the dark-green
velvet of the cedars and hemlocks.&nbsp; Each birch stands forth,
a slender Dan&aelig;, white feet in a drift of gold.&nbsp; The
woods here on the island are thinning rapidly.&nbsp; All sorts of
hidden dells and boulders are coming to light.&nbsp; Soon the
whole island will lie open to the sight, and then there will no
longer be anything mysterious about it.</p>
<p>Dried heads of goldenrod, life everlasting, and a few closed
gentians are all that are left of the flowers; but the red and
orange <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>garlands of the bittersweet wave from every bush, the
juniper berries are purple, and the sumacs are a wonder of great
garnet velvet cones.</p>
<p>From a walk round the trails I bring in an assortment of
seeds: beggar&rsquo;s ticks, stick-seeds, Spanish needles,
pitchforks&mdash;&ldquo;the tramps of the vegetable world,&rdquo;
Burroughs calls them.&nbsp; They cover my skirt, they cling to my
woolen leggings, they perch on the brim of my hat.&nbsp; Little
pocket-shaped cases, pods with hooks, seeds shaped like tiny twin
turtles, and furry balls like miniature chestnut burrs.&nbsp; As
I pick and brush and tear them off I wish I knew what plants had
fathered every one of them.</p>
<p>At the approach of cold weather the small animals and the few
birds that are left draw nearer to the house.&nbsp; Grouse are in
all the paths, flying up everywhere.&nbsp; They rise with a
thrashing, pounding noise and soar away over the bushes, to
settle again only a little further on.&nbsp; Last evening, at
twilight, two of them came on the porch, the little cock ruffling
it bravely, wings dragging, fantail spread, ruff standing
valiantly erect.&nbsp; A hen followed sedately at his
heels.&nbsp; They are very pretty, about the size of bantam
chickens.&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>How I hope that I shall be here to see their young in
the spring!</p>
<p>This afternoon a red squirrel came round the corner of the
house and sat down, absentmindedly, beside me on a bench.&nbsp;
When he looked up and saw what he had done he gave a shriek and a
bound and fled chattering off toward the sundial.&nbsp; But he
will come back and will probably be darting into the house when
he thinks my back is turned, for there is nothing half so
impudent or so mischievous as the red squirrel.&nbsp; I am told
that they do not &ldquo;den in&rdquo; as the chipmunks do.</p>
<p>The rabbits do their best to help me get rid of my
stores.&nbsp; There are hundreds of them about.&nbsp; They sit
under the bushes, peering out; they appear and disappear between
the dry stalks of the brakes.&nbsp; At evening they come close to
the house, and catch bits of bread and potatoes thrown to them,
then sit in the paths munching contentedly.&nbsp; They are not
rabbits, correctly speaking, but Canadian hares, with long brown
fur, bulging black eyes, furry ears, fringed with black, and very
long hind legs.&nbsp; One of them comes so close and seems so
fearless that it should not be difficult to tame him.&nbsp; I
have named him <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Peter.&nbsp; These hares turn snow-white in winter, I am
told.&nbsp; Even now their coats are showing white where the
winter coat is growing.</p>
<p>In the dusk the porcupines come pushing through the fallen
leaves, snuffling and grunting.&nbsp; Away in the woods the
bobcats scream and snarl.&nbsp; The natives accuse the bobcat of
a pretty trick of lying flattened out on a limb, waiting for his
prey to pass underneath, then he drops on its back to tear with
tooth and talon.&nbsp; They warn me not to walk in the woods
after dark, for fear of this Canada lynx.</p>
<p>But my natural histories say that, while the lynx sometimes
follows the hunter for long distances, he does it only because he
is curious, and that there is no authentic record of the
bobcat&rsquo;s ever having attacked a man.&nbsp; So I shall
continue to take my walks abroad, without fear that a fierce tree
cat will drop on me.&nbsp; But late in the night, when I am waked
by that eerie sound, that begins with a low meow, like the cry of
the house cat, and goes on louder and louder, to end in a horrid
screech, full of a malevolent violence, I cover my head and am
glad that I am safe indoors.&nbsp; <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>I know that the lynx has come forth
from his lair in a hollow tree and is hunting my poor
rabbits.</p>
<p>There is no telephone line to the island; sometimes I am
stormbound for a week, but in some underground way, the news of
the neighborhood reaches me sooner or later.&nbsp; Therefore,
when I came out of doors the other morning, I was instantly aware
of a sense of impending disaster, that hung over all the
landscape.&nbsp; There was no cheerful popping of guns in the
fields, no hoarse voice bawled to the cattle.&nbsp; At
Blake&rsquo;s the cause of the silence was explained.&nbsp; All
the men round Many Islands had been summoned to the County Court
at Frontenac, to be tried for the illegal netting and export of
fish out of season.&nbsp; A knot of angry men had gathered on the
shore, discussing the summons; anxious women hovered in the
background; speculation was rife as to the identity of the
informer.</p>
<p>It could have been none of our men, for the obvious reason
that all were in the same boat.&nbsp; Black Jack Beaulac, Yankee
Jim, Little Jack, Long Joe, William Foret, all had received the
same summons.&nbsp; It must have been an inspector from Glen
Avon.</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;Did we not all remember a strange, white boat in
the lake?&nbsp; That was, without doubt, the fish warden come to
spy out for nets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know very little about the legality of nets versus hooks, or
the open and closed seasons for fishing, but even to my ignorance
there seemed grave doubts about the line of defense to be
offered, and I was conscious that, being an alien and a
&ldquo;sport&rdquo; (vernacular for sportsman, that is, summer
visitor), the matter was not being freely discussed in my
presence.</p>
<p>Next morning, while it was yet dark, Foret&rsquo;s motor boat
was heard, chugging solemnly round the shore, gathering up the
victims to take them to court.&nbsp; All day the women went
softly, each wondering what was happening to her man, and
devising means for scraping up the money for fines, if fines it
had to be.&nbsp; Henry Blake went off to town to the trial, and
the day passed gray and lowering.</p>
<p>At red sunset the boat turned in at the narrows, but before
she hove in sight the very beat of her engine signaled
victory.&nbsp; She came swinging down the lake, her crew upright,
alert, the flag of Canada flew in the wind, her propeller kicked
the water joyously.&nbsp; As she made the round of the lake, to
Blake&rsquo;s, to <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Beaulac&rsquo;s, to Drapeau&rsquo;s, to the Mines, it
needed none to tell us that all was well.</p>
<p>Foret touched at the island last to give news of the
fight.&nbsp; The case had been dismissed for lack of
evidence.&nbsp; There had been no conviction, no fines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen that there were no witnesses?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>Foret took out his pouch and stuffed his pipe carefully before
he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was eight or nine fellers there from Blue
Bay,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They looked like they&rsquo;d
come to testify, but, after we had talked to them a bit, it
seemed like they hadn&rsquo;t nothing at all to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had you told them?&rdquo; I persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we told them that if any man felt like he&rsquo;d
any information to give, concerning netting fer fish, he&rsquo;d
best make his plans to leave the lake afore twelve o&rsquo;clock
to-night.&nbsp; We meant it too; they knowed that.&nbsp; Black
Jack give them some very plain talk, Black Jack did.&nbsp; I
guess,&rdquo; with a grin, &ldquo;I guess that I was about the
politest man there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fined once,&rdquo; William went on,
reminiscently, &ldquo;twenty-five dollars it was too, an&rsquo;
it just about cleaned me out.&nbsp; They put <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>me on oath,
you see, an&rsquo; of course, when a man&rsquo;s on his oath he
can&rsquo;t lie.&nbsp; But the next time I went to town I seen a
lawyer, an&rsquo; he told me they hadn&rsquo;t no right to ask me
that question.&nbsp; A man ain&rsquo;t called on to testify
against himself.&nbsp; So now, when the judge asks me: &lsquo;Did
you, or did you not, net fer fish?&rsquo;&nbsp; I says,
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s fer you to prove.&nbsp; Bring on your
witnesses.&rsquo;&nbsp; Howsoever,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;as
long as all this has come up, I guess we&rsquo;d as well eat
mudcats fer a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So mudcats it was, until the herring began to run.</p>
<p>Foret has kept me supplied with fish this fall, explaining
carefully that he will sell me pickerel, herring, and catfish but
not bass.&nbsp; Bass, being a game fish, may not be caught for
the market.&nbsp; I have paid for the pickerel by the pound and
the bass have been gifts, for, as William justly remarks:
&ldquo;What are a few bass, now and then, in a friendly
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Foret is long, lean, powerful, with thin, keen face, steady,
dark eyes, and the long, silent tread of the woodsman.&nbsp;
Sometimes he works in the Mica Mines; sometimes he farms a bit,
or fells trees.&nbsp; More often he hunts and fishes, but always
he is a delightful <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>companion, because of his unconquerable optimism and
fervent interest in all that concerns a matter in hand.&nbsp; He
never admits a difficulty, no obstacle ever daunts him, and no
one has ever heard him say an unkind thing about any living
creature.</p>
<p>When William goes off to a dance, Jean Foret is wild with
anxiety.&nbsp; When he drinks a bit too much and the other men
throw him into a hayfield or a barn, to sleep it off, she ranges
the county in a despairing search.&nbsp; When he sobers and comes
home, subdued and bearing gifts, who is so contrite as he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again will I go to a dance.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing to it at all,&rdquo; he assures you.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
man&rsquo;s better off to home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But once in so often William takes his fling&mdash;only he is
never ugly or quarrelsome when he drinks.&nbsp; Even when his
mind has lost control, he is quiet and peaceable, they say.</p>
<p>The Forets live on the mainland, three miles off, along the
shore.&nbsp; William is building their house by degrees.&nbsp;
This season he went as far as the inner wall, frame, studding,
windows, chimney, and floor.&nbsp; There is also an outer casing
of builder&rsquo;s paper tacked on with small disks of tin.&nbsp;
The whole edifice <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>stands on stilts, about five feet off the ground, giving
fine harbor for the hounds, and a pig or two beneath.&nbsp; The
first time I called to see them William made a great show of
driving these animals forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boards is so thin,&rdquo; he apologized,
&ldquo;that it seems like I can smell them dogs up through the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I remember that one thickness of board and a few sheets
of paper are all that stand between the Forets and the winter
blasts, I shudder.&nbsp; Not so the Forets.&nbsp; They are
apparently quite undismayed and look forward to the approach of
winter without misgiving.</p>
<p>The house is divided into two rooms, each about ten feet
square.&nbsp; There are lace curtains at the tiny windows, bright
pictures, mostly colored calendars, a gay rag carpet, and over
all the comfort of an exquisite neatness, for Mrs. Foret is the
cleanest housekeeper imaginable&mdash;Jennie Foret, with her
snapping, black eyes, her dark hair upreared in a militant
pompadour, her trim, alert figure, and quick, light
movements.&nbsp; Where did she acquire her love of order and her
dainty, cleanly ways, I wonder?</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>It is a
friendly place.&nbsp; Chickens, ducks, geese, cats, dogs, horses
and cows roll, run, squawk, and squeal all over the
hillside.&nbsp; In the cove before the house live-boxes are
moored, motor boat and skiffs lie at anchor.&nbsp; There are nets
and skins drying on the fences.&nbsp; Two bunches of ribbon-grass
do duty for a formal garden, standing sentinel on either side of
the path that winds to the door.&nbsp; The house looks away
across the &ldquo;drowned lands&rdquo; where the wicked roots and
snags of the submerged forest stand in the water, threatening
navigation.&nbsp; The channel to the landing is winding and
treacherous.&nbsp; But, once at the door, no guest is ever turned
away.&nbsp; Wandering miner, tramp, bewildered emigrant, each is
sure of a meal, a bed, and something to set him on his way.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Wild</span> geese flying over, cold
mornings, colder nights, warn me that it is time to lay in
supplies of firewood, oil and food against the coming of
winter.&nbsp; Last evening a laden rowboat passed the island,
going eastward under the Moon of Travelers.&nbsp; In the stern
were a stove, a chair, a coffeepot, a frying pan, a great pile of
bedding, and, surmounting all, a fiddle.&nbsp; The man at the
oars threw me a surly &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; and turning,
looked back at me with a scowl.&nbsp; It was Old Bill Shelly, the
hermit of the countryside&mdash;trapper, frogger, netter of fish,
and general ne&rsquo;er-do-well.&nbsp; He has built log shacks
all round the shores&mdash;little, one-room affairs, filled with
a miscellaneous assortment of nets, guns, dogs, all forlorn and
filthy past description.&nbsp; When one becomes uninhabitable, he
leaves it and moves on to the next, but at the approach of cold
weather he always goes into winter quarters at Blue Bay, and his
flitting, like the flitting of the other wild things, means that
all nature is getting ready for &ldquo;<i>le grand
fr&ecirc;te</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Poor
Shelly! his is the only hostile glance that I have encountered in
my wanderings.&nbsp; Even Old Kate, the witch at Les Rapides, has
smiled at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind Old Kate,&rdquo; the neighbors caution me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If she ever crosses her fingers at you, it&rsquo;s all day
with you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when I met her in the road she spoke in quite a friendly
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold weather coming,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get
in your wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless she thinks me another as crazy as herself.</p>
<p>So I must set about getting enough wood to last until the
January sawing, and must pack eggs and butter against the time
when hens stop laying and cows go dry, for there is no shop
nearer than Sark, six miles away, and even if one could reach it,
through the winds on the lake, or the drifts in the roads, there
would be no butter or eggs to buy.</p>
<p>Tom Jackson, at the far end of the lake, has consented to sell
me eight cords of hard wood; but to bring it to the island we
must hire the big scow that ferries mica from the mines, and must
have Foret&rsquo;s motor boat to tug it.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>This
life is a great education as regards the relative values of
things.&nbsp; Wood and water, oil and food, are seen here in
their true perspective.&nbsp; Already I have learned to rate the
wealth of a family by the size of the woodpile, that stands, like
a rampart in the dooryard, for I know what a big stock of logs
means in thrift, foresight, and hard labor.&nbsp; I know what it
cost to get my own wood to my hand.</p>
<p>City folk can pass a loaded woodcart without special emotion,
indeed, half the time they do not see it, so concerned are they
with the price of theater tickets, or the cut of the
season&rsquo;s gowns.&nbsp; But I shall never look at one without
seeing again a great scow moving slowly on the blue bosom of a
lake, and I shall smell the delicious odor of fresh-cut maple,
beech, and cedar, far sweeter than the breath of any summer
garden.</p>
<p>Ah me!&nbsp; How prosaic will seem the city&rsquo;s
conveniences of pipes and furnaces as compared with the daily
adventure of carrying in the logs, and battling down a windswept
trail to dip the pails into a pit of crystal ice water!&nbsp;
Never again shall I turn on the spigot in a bathroom without a
swift vision of that drift-filled path through the woods that <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>leads out on
the lake, to where the upright stake marks the water hole, hidden
under last night&rsquo;s fall of snow.</p>
<p>To one who has only to push a button or strike a match to have
a room flooded with light, the problem of illumination is not
perplexing.&nbsp; Here, the five-gallon oil tank must be ferried
across the lake to Blake&rsquo;s farm; whence it must be again
sent by boat to Jackson&rsquo;s shore, and there loaded on a
wagon for Sark.&nbsp; Back it must come to the shore, to
Blake&rsquo;s, and to the island storehouse&mdash;all this taking
from ten days to two weeks, according to when Henry Blake is
sending in to the store.</p>
<p>The city postman is no very heroic figure, but little Jimmie
Dodd is, as he beats his way across the lake, and through the
high drifts on the island, his slender body bowed under a great
bag of mail, his small face blue with the cold.&nbsp; Letters
mean something to us here.&nbsp; They leave the train at Glen
Avon, they come by stage to Sark, then they follow the oil tank
route over water and wood trails to me, and it takes as long to
get a letter from &ldquo;The States&rdquo; as to hear from
England, &ldquo;The Old Country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>To-day
a shrill, childish yell sounded from the water.&nbsp; There was
Jimmie, in a boat, with a great basket of eggs.&nbsp; He was
fending carefully off from shore, as the high wind threatened to
dash his fragile cargo against the rocks.&nbsp; Before those eggs
were loaded into the skiff a woman had walked five miles with
them on her back.&nbsp; I spent a long, happy afternoon, standing
them upright on their small ends in boxes of salt.&nbsp; When
they were all packed, twenty-four dozens of eggs seemed a great
number for one woman to eat, even if she expected to have a long
winter in which to eat them.</p>
<p>The wood is all stacked on the porch, but it was hard work to
get it there.&nbsp; The scow docked on a beach at the far side of
the island, there the logs were gayly thrown ashore, and there
Tom Jackson washed his hands of all further responsibility
concerning them.&nbsp; The duck-shooting had commenced; no man
could be found to draw that wood through the island to the house,
so there it stayed.</p>
<p>At length William Foret came to my aid and promised to haul
it, and I was jubilant.&nbsp; I did not then know that Foret will
promise any one anything.&nbsp; No man can promise more <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>delightfully
than he.&nbsp; He is always perfectly willing, apparently, to
help anyone out of any dilemma, he recognizes no difficulty in
the way, and to hear him make light of one&rsquo;s most pressing
problem is to come to the conclusion that there is no problem
there.&nbsp; So when William promised to get the wood to the
house I believed him and was content.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the days went on, each colder than the last.&nbsp;
Each morning I toiled to and fro from the beach, carrying enough
wood, two sticks at a time, to last the day.&nbsp; Each evening I
made a pilgrimage along the shore to Foret&rsquo;s to ask why
tarried the wheels of his chariot.&nbsp; Sometimes he was at home
and greeted me with a charming cordiality, more often he was
away, fishing or hunting or cutting down a bee-tree.&nbsp; Always
he was coming to the island the very next day.&nbsp; The Forets
were cut to the heart to learn that I was carrying my own
wood.&nbsp; But for this reason or that, William would have been
there long ago.&nbsp; I was not to worry at all.&nbsp; That fuel
would be stacked before the snow fell.</p>
<p>I always started to Foret&rsquo;s with wrath in my heart, I
always left there soothed and comforted, and by the time I had
eaten supper in <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>the boat, had watched the sunset over the islands, and
had listened to the bell on Blake&rsquo;s old red cow, I would go
to bed really believing that William was coming the next day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, he did appear one afternoon and attacked the
woodpile with a very fury of energy, trundling load after load up
the trail for perhaps an hour.&nbsp; Suddenly he sat down his
barrow and gazed fixedly out across the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I heard my gun,&rdquo; he observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two fellers from Glen Avon, come to have me cut
them down a bee-tree.&nbsp; I told the woman&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
Mrs. Foret&mdash;&ldquo;to take the little rifle and shoot three
times if they come, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s her.&nbsp; I got to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Foret!&rdquo; I expostulated, almost with
tears, &ldquo;have you the heart to leave this wood?&nbsp; Here,
you take my pistol and shoot for them to come over and lend a
hand with this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But William was already climbing into his boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little rifle,&rdquo; he said,
sentimentally, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go,&rdquo; and away he
chugged, leaving me raging on the shore.</p>
<p>After all he did come back, and the very <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>next day,
Mrs. Foret and little Emmie, their adopted child, with him.&nbsp;
We all carried wood, Jean and I in baskets, little Emmie, one
stick at a time in her small arms.&nbsp; By evening it was all
stacked and we were exhausted.&nbsp; There it stands, eight feet
high, all round the house and the place looks like a
stockade.</p>
<p>After supper William cleaned and oiled the famous pistol; we
women washed the dishes and little Emmie skirmished about,
getting in every one&rsquo;s way, while Jean Foret shrieked dire
threats of the laying on of a &ldquo;gad&rdquo; that one knew
would never be applied.&nbsp; The crows flew home across the
sky.&nbsp; The child crept close to William&rsquo;s side and fell
asleep.&nbsp; He moved the heavy little head very gently, until
it rested more comfortably against his great shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our little girl would have been just the age of this
one, if she had lived,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There was a sudden hush, while I remembered the Foret baby
that had died at birth, when Jennie had almost died too, and when
Dr. Le Baron had said that she could never have another.</p>
<p>Presently we gathered barrow, baskets and sleeping child, and
I watched their boat go <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>off, threading its way between the
islands and points, a little moving speck on the amber water.</p>
<p>Across, on the shore, Joey Drapeau was plowing for the fall
rye.&nbsp; His voice, bawling threatening and slaughter to the
steaming horses, came across to me, softened by the
distance.&nbsp; It was Saturday night.&nbsp; Soon the work would
be done for another week.&nbsp; Then the men would go out on the
lake, jerking along in their cranky little flat-bottomed
punts.&nbsp; They would sing under the stars, girls&rsquo; voices
mingling with their harsher tones.</p>
<p>Little fiery clouds broke off from the sides of the crater,
into which the sun had dropped, and were drifting across the
quiet sky.&nbsp; A long finger of light crossed over the island
and ran like a torch along the eastern horizon, turning the
treetops to flame color and burnished copper, and the upland
meadows to gold.</p>
<p>On the island the woods were dark, and somewhere in their
depths a screech owl&rsquo;s cry shuddered away into silence.</p>
<h2><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> is the month of
mosses.&nbsp; Every fallen tree, every rotting stump, every rock,
the trodden paths, and even the hard face of the cliff, are
padded deep with velvet.&nbsp; The color ranges from clear
emerald, out through the tints to silvery, sage green, and back
through the shades to an olive brown, almost as dark as the earth
itself.&nbsp; Round the shores the driftwood is piled high on the
beach.&nbsp; It looks like bleached bones of monsters long dead,
huge vertebrae, leg bones, skulls and branching antlers.&nbsp;
The trees are bare, the brakes dry and crumbling, but the north
point of the island, its one naked ugly spot of the summer, is
now covered with a blood-red carpet.&nbsp; A close-growing,
grassy weed has turned brilliant crimson and clothed it with
beauty.&nbsp; Far away on the lake I am guided home by that flare
of color on the point.</p>
<p>The birds are gone, all but the crows, that perch on the
tallest trees and lift their hoarse voices in a mournful
chorus.&nbsp; But now is the time to go bird&rsquo;s-nesting, to
find the homes of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>all the vireos, warblers, creepers, and sparrows that
made the island their breeding ground.&nbsp; The nests of the
vireos, woven of birch bark, bits of hornet&rsquo;s nests, grass
and scraps of paper, are easy to find, for the pretty, hanging
baskets are fastened in the crotches of the bushes and low
saplings.&nbsp; The others are not so readily discovered, and it
was by merest accident that I came across the home of the brown
thrasher, who made the summer vocal with his beautiful
song.&nbsp; It was on the ground and so near the house that I
wonder that we did not walk into it.&nbsp; It is a mere bunch of
twigs, so loosely twisted together that it fell apart when it was
moved.</p>
<p>Every afternoon I go faggotting, bringing in armloads of dry
sumac and fallen branches.&nbsp; They are not especially good for
kindling, but now that the deer season is on, no man will work;
so until after November fifteenth, the reign of the
Hunter&rsquo;s Moon, the brush pile must serve.&nbsp; It takes
constant gathering to collect enough to start the hardwood fires,
and a wet day sets me back sadly.&nbsp; I pile up as much as I
can in the empty sleeping shacks, to keep it dry, and I can only
hope that the snow will not come before someone has been <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>induced to
lay aside his gun and cut a cord or two of driftwood
kindling.</p>
<p>Butterflies are always coming in on the twigs.&nbsp; With
their wings folded flat together, showing only their dry
undersides, they look so like old withered leaves that it is only
when the warmth of the room wakes them, and they flutter off to
the windows, that they can be recognized as butterflies at
all.&nbsp; One flew to the south window yesterday and crawled
there, beating his delicate wings against the glass all
morning.&nbsp; He was brown, tan and yellow on the upper side but
underneath so like a dry, woolly old leaf as to be an amazing bit
of nature&rsquo;s mimicry.&nbsp; As I looked at his poor, torn
wings and feebly waving antenn&aelig; he seemed suddenly the very
oldest thing, the lone survivor of a forgotten summer, a piteous
little Tithonus, to whom had been granted the terrible gift of
immortality, without the boon of an immortal youth.</p>
<p>At first I thought that he was being given a respite from the
common fate of butterflies, for I did not then know that the
angle wings can last over the winter, lying dormant in protected
places, and that the last brood of a summer can live until
another spring.&nbsp; I even <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>planned to outwit nature by feeding
this one and keeping him alive in the artificial summer of the
warm house.&nbsp; I made a sirup of sugar and water and offered
it but the butterfly would none of it, only crawling and beating
his wings in a vain effort to escape through the glass into the
bleak November sunshine.&nbsp; At length I carried him to the
door, and he fluttered off to a bush and clung there.&nbsp; After
turning away for a moment I went back to find him; he was gone;
he had become a dead leaf again.</p>
<p>

"&ldquo;Peter the rabbit, is turning white very rapidly&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;Peter the rabbit, is turning white very rapidly&rdquo;"
 src="images/p53s.jpg" />
</a>Peter, the rabbit, spends most of his time at the door,
waiting for a chance crust.&nbsp; He fsits on his haunches,
rocking gently back and forth, making a soft, little <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>knocking
noise on the porch floor.&nbsp; If I am late in coming out at
mealtimes, he looks at me with so dignified an air of patient
reproof that I feel quite apologetic for having kept him
waiting.&nbsp; His meal finished, he washes his face and paws
carefully, like a cat, then sits in the sun, eyes closed,
forepaws tucked away under his breast and ears laid back along
his shoulders.&nbsp; He is turning white very rapidly.&nbsp; At
first, only his tail, feet, breast and the ends of his ears were
lightly powdered, but now he looks as if he had hopped into a pan
of flour by mistake.</p>
<p>Other hares, now lean and wild, come out of the woods at dusk
and try to share Peter&rsquo;s bread.&nbsp; But he turns on them
fiercely, driving them back over the hill, with an angry noise,
something between a squeal and a grunt.&nbsp; If anyone thinks a
rabbit a meek, poor-spirited creature, he should see Peter, when
threatened with the loss of his dinner.&nbsp; Evidently, he
believes that he has pre-empted this territory and all that goes
here in the way of food, and he means to defend his claim.</p>
<p>Rufus, the red squirrel, torments Peter unmercifully, dashing
across the ground under his nose and snatching the bread from <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>between the
rabbit&rsquo;s very teeth.&nbsp; He is there and away before the
rabbit knows what has happened.&nbsp; Poor, slow little Peter
stood these attacks in bewildered patience for a time, but now he
has worked out a plan for getting even with the squirrel that
serves him fairly well.&nbsp; He sits on his crust, drawing it
out inch by inch from under him as he nibbles, but even at that
Rufus gets about half.&nbsp; I am training the rabbit to take his
food from my hand, for nothing thrown on the ground is safe for
an instant from the little red-brown robber.&nbsp; It took some
very patient sitting to overcome Peter&rsquo;s timidity, but
after the first bit was taken the rest was easy.&nbsp; Now he
comes fearlessly to me as soon as I appear.</p>
<p>The squirrel is growing very tame too, but he will never be as
tranquil a companion as the rabbit.&nbsp; He lacks Bunny&rsquo;s
repose of manner.&nbsp; He is sitting on the windowsill now,
eating a bit of cold potato.&nbsp; He turns it round and round,
nibbling at it daintily.&nbsp; Now and again he stops to lay a
tiny paw on his heart&mdash;or is it his stomach?&nbsp; The area
of his organs is very minute and it may be either.</p>
<p>There is something very flattering in the confidence of these
little creatures of the <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>island.&nbsp; How do they know that
they may safely trust my kindness?&nbsp; How can they be sure
that I will not betray them suddenly with trap or gun?</p>
<p>The rabbit came into the house yesterday, padding about
noiselessly on his cushioned toes.&nbsp; He stopped at each chair
and stood on his hind feet, resting his forepaws on the
seat.&nbsp; He examined everything, ears wriggling, nose
quivering, tail thumping on the carpet.&nbsp; Suddenly he
discovered that the door had blown shut and then he went quite
wild with fear.&nbsp; He was in a trap, he thought, and tore
round and round the room, jumping against the window panes,
dashing his head against the walls until I feared that he would
injure himself before I could reach the door to open it.&nbsp;
Poor little Peter, he is not valiant after all.&nbsp; He comes in
still, but always keeps close to the door, and the way of escape
must always be open.</p>
<p>The men on the mainland hunt over the islands, putting on the
dogs to drive off the game.&nbsp; When the ice holds, the hounds
will come over of their own accord to course the rabbits.&nbsp; I
should like to feel that for the term of my stay this one island
could be a <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>place of safety for the animals that take refuge here,
and so I have paid visits of ceremony to the neighboring farms to
explain that I shall spend the winter and to ask that the dogs be
kept off my preserve, as far as possible for the sake of my
pets.&nbsp; I may say that my wish has been respected in the
kindest way, and my neighbors have done their best to make the
island a sanctuary for the birds and beasts.&nbsp; The first
assurance of each visitor has been, &ldquo;I tied up my dogs
afore I started over.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the opening remark of
an early caller who strode into the room this morning as I was
eating a late breakfast.&nbsp; A reassuring salutation, for
without it I might have feared that the speaker had dropped in to
do me a mischief, his appearance was so very intimidating.&nbsp;
He was tall and very lean, a sort of cross between an Indian and
a crane.&nbsp; His greasy, black hair hung in rattails on the
turned-up collar of a dingy red sweater.&nbsp; He wore a ragged
squirrel-skin cap, tail hanging down behind&mdash;which headgear
he did not remove, and he carried a murderous looking ax.&nbsp;
Following came a boy of about sixteen, whose smile was so
friendly and ingratiating that I felt comforted when I saw
it.&nbsp; The two drew <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>up to the stove, lit pipes,
conversed, and in the round-about course of their remarks I
gathered that they had heard of my need of kindling wood and had
come to cut me a cord.&nbsp; Presently they retired to a secluded
spot on the shore and chopped away, emerging every half hour or
so to bring a load up to the house.</p>
<p>In this country men eat where they work, so toward noon I
bestirred myself to prepare what I considered a particularly good
dinner for my &ldquo;hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had a theory that my
chances of getting future kindling cut depended on the good
impression made on these first workmen.&nbsp; I had corned beef,
potatoes, peas, and tinned beans.&nbsp; I made hot biscuit, cake,
stewed apples, and prepared the inevitable pot of strong
tea.&nbsp; The man drew his chair to the table with perfect
self-possession, speared a potato from the pot with his knife and
remarked: &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t much of a cook, are
you?&rdquo;&mdash;adding, kindly, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just
try yer tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He assured me subsequently that he had no particular fault to
find with my dinner.&nbsp; He only meant to put me at my ease and
to make conversation.</p>
<p>When he departed in the evening, after <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>having cut
and stacked an incredible amount of wood, he assured me that he
would be ready to work for me at any time.&nbsp; I had only to
&ldquo;holler&rdquo; and he would drop a day&rsquo;s hunting to
come to my aid.&nbsp; So the dinner could not have been so
unsatisfactory after all.</p>
<p>News of the Great War has come to Many Islands.&nbsp; William
Foret returned from Glen Avon the other day with great tales of
armed men guarding the railroad bridges against the
Germans.&nbsp; He also brought the information that I am a German
spy.&nbsp; He heard that at the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman on the island is there for no good,&rdquo;
the loafers were saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a spy.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got a writing machine there an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s
sending off letters every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One inventive soul was even asserting that I am not a woman at
all, but a man in woman&rsquo;s clothes and that there is a
wireless station here.</p>
<p>But William stood up for me bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy, nawthin,&rdquo; he scoffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
could she be a spyin&rsquo; on there on that island?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nawthin&rsquo; there but rabbits.&nbsp; No, as I
understand it, she&rsquo;s some sort of a book-writer off fer
health.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got no wireless, <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>that I know,
fer I&rsquo;ve been over the ground there time and
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the crowd was not convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d ought to be investigated,&rdquo; they
declared.</p>
<p>Then William rose to the occasion nobly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no German spy,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an all-right woman, and ef any man feels like
makin&rsquo; any trouble fer her, me an&rsquo; Black Jack and
Yankee Jim stands ready to make it very onhealthy fer
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them,&rdquo; added William, with a delighted
grin, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d a little gun here an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;d use it on the first man that come on the island
without you knowed him fer a friend.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t say
that you only stood five feet five in yer boots and didn&rsquo;t
weigh over a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the shield of William&rsquo;s favor and the wholly
undeserved reputation of being a good shot, I continue to sleep
o&rsquo; nights, but I have no fancy for being investigated.</p>
<p>Last night a boat stopped at the shore, long after dark, and I
was startled for a moment until I heard a chant that rose at the
dock and continued up the trail to the house.&nbsp; Uncle Dan
Cassidy had brought over the mail and <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>a Thanksgiving box from home, but he
was taking no chances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, friends, don&rsquo;t shoot, don&rsquo;t
shoot,&rdquo; he sang until he stepped on the porch.</p>
<p>But while war and its rumors excite us, all topics pale in
interest before the fact that the herring have begun to
run.&nbsp; Whether battles are lost or won we still have to eat,
a pig or a sheep does not last very long and the fish are a great
part of the winter food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They save the meat,&rdquo; says Harry Spriggins.</p>
<p>So when the first silver herring came up in the net there was
great rejoicing.&nbsp; Then the little skiffs and punts started
out, dancing and curtseying on the waves.&nbsp; The nets were
stretched across the narrows between the islands, and, during the
herring run, no other work was done.&nbsp; The season is short;
there is no time to waste.&nbsp; The run began this year on the
twelfth, the greatest catch was on the eighteenth, the fishing
was over on the twenty-eighth.&nbsp; The fish do not come up
except at a temperature of about thirty-four.</p>
<p>These are the bright, frosty days&mdash;days when the blood
runs quick and the air tastes like wine; when the water is
deep-blue, the <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>waves run high and the whitecaps race in to the
shores.</p>
<p>The little boats bob up and down, the long nets come up
spangled with the gleaming fish, and the tubs and boxes are piled
high with the silver catch.&nbsp; As the fishermen pass they stop
at the island and throw me off a herring or two.&nbsp; Every
house on the mainland reeks; barrels and kegs stand in every
dooryard, and everywhere the women and children are busy cleaning
the fish.</p>
<h2><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time of great winds has come,
the heavy November gales that roar down the lakes, lashing the
water into white-capped waves, dashing the driftwood against the
rocks and decking the beaches with long wreaths of yellow
foam.&nbsp; The swell is so strong and the waves so high that
even the men do not care to venture out.&nbsp; When I must get
over to Blake&rsquo;s farm I hug the shore of the island to the
point, then dash across the channel between this land and his,
and the wind turns my light skiff round and round before I can
catch the lee again.</p>
<p>All night the house rocks and shivers and the trees creak,
groan and crash down in the woods.&nbsp; I am afraid to walk the
trails because of falling branches, for if I were struck down I
should lie in the path for days and no one would know that I had
been hurt.</p>
<p>These winds give the strangest effect of distant music.&nbsp;
I am always thinking that I can almost hear the sound of
trumpets, blowing far away.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Inside
the house is warm and comfortable, with its creamy yellow walls
of unpainted wood, its many windows, its pictures, its books; but
I am lonely; I cannot settle to any occupation.&nbsp; The
constant roaring of the wind unnerves me, the gray, scudding
clouds depress me.&nbsp; A hound on the shore bays and howls day
and night.&nbsp; I have heard no human voice for more than a
week.</p>
<p>The storm died away in a smothering fog that settled down on
the very surface of the lake, blotting out everything.&nbsp; I
could not see one inch beyond the shore.&nbsp; The mainland was
hidden, the opposite island was invisible&mdash;everything was
gone except the land on which I stood.&nbsp; I could hear voices
at the farms, the sound of oars, and people talking in the boats
as they passed.&nbsp; Men were hunting on the mainland, almost a
mile away.&nbsp; I could hear their shots and the cries of the
hounds, but I might as well have been stricken blind, for all
that I could distinguish.&nbsp; All sorts of fears assailed
me.&nbsp; Suppose men should land on the island in the fog, how
could I see to escape them?&nbsp; Suppose the fog should last and
last, how would I dare to go out in a boat for any
provisions?&nbsp; Suppose I <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>should be ill, or hurt, how could I
signal to the farm for help?</p>
<p>By evening the fog had thoroughly frightened me; it was time
to pull myself together.&nbsp; So I cooked a particularly good
dinner, read a new book for awhile, then went to bed praying that
the sun would be shining in the morning.</p>
<p>After being asleep for what seemed hours, I was aware of a
loud shouting, followed by heavy steps on the porch and a voice
calling as someone knocked and pounded on the door.&nbsp; I
stumbled out of bed, half asleep, and groped my way to the lamp,
fortunately forgetting all about the pistol laid by my side for
just such an emergency.&nbsp; When the door was finally opened,
the shapeless bulk of a woman confronted me&mdash;the very
largest woman I have ever seen.&nbsp; She loomed like a giant
against a solid bank of fog that rolled in behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I am,&rdquo; she
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all turned round.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been rowing hours and hours in the fog, and I&rsquo;ve
a boy, a pail of eggs, a mess of catfish and a little wee baby in
the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I ejaculated,
&ldquo;what are <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>you doing out in a boat with a baby on a night like
this?&nbsp; Who are you anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Spriggins&rsquo; farm,&rdquo; she
answered, &ldquo;the place where you gits yer chickens at.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been over at Drapeau&rsquo;s spending the evening and
I started to row home two hours ago.&nbsp; But the fog got me all
turned round, and when I struck this shore I says: &lsquo;This
must be the island where the woman&rsquo;s at.&nbsp; Ef
she&rsquo;s to the house I&rsquo;ll wake her and git me a
light.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave her a lantern and she went off to the shore, while I
threw fresh logs on the smoldering fire and tried to wake
myself.</p>
<p>Presently a dismal procession returned: a boy, laden with
shawls and wraps, the woman carrying a baby.&nbsp; When that
infant was unwrapped, it needed not its proud mother&rsquo;s
introduction to tell me whose child it was.&nbsp; Harry Spriggins
is a small, wiry man, with sharp, black eyes and a face like a
weasel.&nbsp; The baby was exactly like him.&nbsp; They were a
forlorn trio, and, oh, so dirty!&nbsp; My heart sank as I
surveyed them, realizing that they were on my hands for the
night.&nbsp; Then I felt properly ashamed of myself, for if the
poor soul had not found the island she might have <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>been on the
lake in an open boat until daylight; and by this time a rain was
falling, quite heavily enough to have swamped so unseaworthy a
craft as her small, flat-bottomed punt.</p>
<p>For some time we sat gazing at one another, while I tried to
determine what should be done with my guests.&nbsp; Finally I
sent the boy to the storehouse for extra mattresses, and prepared
them beds on the floor.&nbsp; Clean sheets were spread over
everything.&nbsp; Probably the woman had never slept on clean
sheets before, but I reasoned that sheets could be washed more
easily than blankets, and just then washing seemed to me very
essential.</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock we all settled down for the night, but
not to sleep&mdash;oh, no!&nbsp; The woman was far too excited
for that.&nbsp; Thanks to the fire that I had made, in my
stupidity, and to the air in the cabin, I could not sleep either,
so I heard a great deal of the inside history of the
neighborhood, before morning.</p>
<p>I learned that minks are a menace to the poultry industry here
about.&nbsp; In Spriggins&rsquo; own barnyard, a flock of
thirty-six young turkeys were found all lying dead in a row, with
their necks chewed off&mdash;a plain case of <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>mink, and a
dire blow to the finances of the family.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock I had the life history of a Plymouth
Rock rooster, of superlative intelligence, that always crowed at
that precise hour.&nbsp; At four I was roused from an uneasy doze
by the query: &ldquo;Do you know anything about Dr.
So-and-So&rsquo;s cure for &lsquo;obsidy&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After puzzling over the word for some minutes I gathered that
&ldquo;obesity&rdquo; was what was meant, for my guest went on,
pathetically enough, to tell me how hard her work was and how she
suffered in doing it, burdened with that mountain of flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another cure,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. So-and-So&rsquo;s, but it calls for a
Turkish bath, and where could I get that?&nbsp; Beside, I could
never do all that rolling and kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering through the gloom at what looked like the outline of
an elephant on the floor, I did not see how she could, but I felt
that if there were any known way of getting that woman into a
Turkish bath I would cheerfully bear the expense.</p>
<p>At six I gave up the struggle and rose for the day, stumbling
about from cabin to kitchen <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to cook breakfast in the
semi-darkness, for the fog was still thick.&nbsp; At nine, the
day being a little lighter, I made the mistake of suggesting that
the boy row over to Blake&rsquo;s for some bread and the
mail.&nbsp; He departed, and stayed for hours.&nbsp; Soon his
mother began to fidget and finally set off for the shore to
search for him, leaving that changeling of a baby in my care.</p>
<p>There it lay on my bed, staring at me with its black beads of
eyes, and looking as old as the Pharaoh of the Exodus and as
crafty.&nbsp; The mother stayed and stayed away.&nbsp; I had
visions of being left with that child on my hands all
winter.&nbsp; I saw myself walking it up and down the cabin
through the long nights.&nbsp; I saw myself sharing with it my
last spoonful of condensed milk, but, as I surveyed it, I knew
what I would do first.&nbsp; I would give it the best bath it had
ever had in its short life and I would burn its filthy little
clothes.</p>
<p>But while I was harboring these designs against that innocent
child its mother came back, her hands full of green leaves.&nbsp;
She had not found the boy, but she had gathered what she called
&ldquo;Princess Fern.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;This is awful good fer the blood,&rdquo; she
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ef yer blood is bad, this will make it as
pure as spring water; if it&rsquo;s pure, this will keep it
so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good fer you either way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mention of blood led naturally to the recital of the
various accidents she had seen, and I learned that there are
several blood healers in the neighborhood&mdash;persons who can
stop the flow by the recitation of a certain verse of
Scripture.&nbsp; A man can perform this miracle for a woman and a
woman for a man, but a man cannot cure another man, nor a woman
another woman.&nbsp; This charm must never be revealed.&nbsp; It
can only be transmitted at death.&nbsp; It is a sure cure for
blood flow and quite authentic, according to Mrs. Spriggins, who
has seen the blood stopped.</p>
<p>While we were discussing this mystery the boy came back,
smilingly, from quite a different direction from the one in which
he had been sent.&nbsp; He had never found the farm, but had been
all this time wandering in the fog.&nbsp; It was all too like a
nightmare.&nbsp; I did not tempt fate by offering any more
suggestions.&nbsp; Instead, I bundled the party into their
various wrappings, led them to their boat, and <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>turned their
faces firmly in the direction of home.&nbsp; Then I sat on the
porch, tracing their progress down the lake by the wailing of
that wretched baby.&nbsp; When the sounds had finally died away,
I went in and scrubbed the cabin from end to end with strong,
yellow soap.</p>
<p>And the sequel to all this?&nbsp; She was not Spriggins&rsquo;
wife at all, but &ldquo;Spriggins&rsquo; woman,&rdquo; and she
was not lost.</p>
<p>When I mentioned her visit the neighbors shook their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t lose old Jane on Many
Islands,&rdquo; they scoffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wanted to see you,
that was all; and she knowed you wouldn&rsquo;t let her land if
she come by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But two men were lost on the lake that night, and I believe
that Jane was lost too.</p>
<p>With the rural love of scandal and the usual disregard of all
laws of probability, the people accuse this woman of all sorts of
outrageous crimes.&nbsp; It is said that she murdered her
daughter for the girl&rsquo;s bit of life insurance, that she has
strangled her own babies, that she bound her aged aunt face
downward on a board, and pushed her out on the lake to
drown.&nbsp; And here was I, all ignorant of the character of my
guest, gravely discussing with <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>this alleged criminal the proper
feeding of infants and the rival merits of toilet soaps.</p>
<p>I stopped at her house the other day to inquire my way.&nbsp;
She greeted me with much cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was certainly fine to me that night,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I donno what we would a-done, ef you
hadn&rsquo;t took us in.&nbsp; The baby would a-been drownded, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I am glad that I was &ldquo;fine&rdquo; to her, for poor
Jane is gone, and she died as she had lived&mdash;without help
and without hope.</p>
<p>Her children&rsquo;s father was away at a dance in Sark when
she fell in their desolate house.&nbsp; Seeing that she did not
rise, one frightened child crept out of bed and covered her
nakedness with an old quilt.&nbsp; In the morning two little
boys, crying and shivering, made their way along the shore to the
place where the man was sleeping off his debauch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home, Pop,&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he would not heed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one of them spells she gits,&rdquo; he
grunted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t no spell, Pop,&rdquo; they
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead, I tell you.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Then
the neighbors, who had never gone to that house when Jane was
alive, went now and comforted the children.&nbsp; They followed
the poor body along the ice to its grave, and Mrs. Spellman, who
has six little ones of her own, went over and took the baby
home.</p>
<p>There are a great many of these irregular unions here, for
Canada is no land of easy divorce.&nbsp; If you are a poor man,
and have any predilection for being legally married, you must
stay with the wife with whom you started.&nbsp; Divorce and
remarriage are not for you.</p>
<p>In a little book of instructions for immigrants and settlers,
published by one of the newspapers, the matter is made very
plain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan there
is no divorce court.&nbsp; Application must be made to the
Dominion Parliament, by means of a private bill, praying for
relief by reason of adultery, or adultery and cruelty, if it is
the wife who is seeking a divorce from her husband.&nbsp; The
charges made are investigated by a special committee of the
Senate, and, if a favorable report is presented to the House, the
bill usually passes.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the little book goes on to
state, very simply, <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>that &ldquo;The expense of obtaining the bill is very
great, exceeding in any event five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for men like Harry Spriggins, whose wife deserted him, or
for Black Jack&rsquo;s woman, whose husband beat her, there is no
way out.&nbsp; They simply take another mate, and stand by the
arrangement as faithfully as may be.</p>

75</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> has thrown a veil of lace
over the islands, a wet, clinging snow that covers every
tree-trunk, rock, and stump, and turns the cedars to mounds of
fluffy whiteness.&nbsp; The paths lie under archways of bending,
snow-laden branches, and all the underbrush is hidden.&nbsp; The
island wears many jewels, for every ice-incrusted twig flashes a
cluster of diamonds, the orange berries of the bittersweet, each
encased in clear ice, are like topaz, and the small frozen pools
between the stones reflect the sky and shine like sapphires.</p>
<p>There have been snows since the first week in November, but
this is the first that has remained, and how it shows the
midnight activities of all the wild folk!&nbsp; The porch floor
is a white page on which they have left their signatures.&nbsp;
Here, by the storeroom door, are innumerable little stitch-like
strokes.&nbsp; They were made by the deer mouse&rsquo;s wee
paws.&nbsp; There are the prints of the squirrel&rsquo;s little
hands and a long swathe, where his brush swept the snow.&nbsp;
The chickadees and nuthatches <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>came very early.&nbsp; Their
three-fingered prints are all over the woodpile, and on the paths
are the blurred, ragged tracks left by the grouse&rsquo;s
snowshoes.&nbsp; Over the hill runs a row of deep, round holes,
showing that a fox has passed that way, and the rabbit&rsquo;s
tracks are everywhere.</p>
<p>Every day the water freezes farther and farther out from the
shores, and it is increasingly difficult to force a channel
through it to the open lake.&nbsp; The bay in front of the
Blake&rsquo;s house is frozen straight across, and I land far
away on the point and scramble through the bushes to the house
when I must go over for the mail.&nbsp; Frozen cascades hang down
over the rocks, pale-blue, jade and softest cream color.&nbsp;
The rocks themselves are capped with frozen spray and the
driftwood wears long beards of ice.</p>
<p>Walking along the beach to-day I heard a great chirping and
twittering, like the sound made by innumerable very small
birds.&nbsp; Could a late flock of migrants be stopping in the
treetops?&nbsp; I wondered.&nbsp; But when I searched for the
birds there were none.&nbsp; The chirping noises came from the
thin shore ice, whose crystals, rubbed together by the gently
moving <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>water, were making the birdlike sounds.&nbsp; Now and
then would come a sudden &ldquo;ping&rdquo; like the stroke on
the wire string of a banjo, and sometimes a clear, sustained
tone, like the note of a violin.</p>
<p>As the ice grew thicker these sounds all stopped and over all
the land broods a profound silence.&nbsp; The winds are still, no
bird voices come out of the woods; even the waves seem hardly to
rise and fall against the shores.&nbsp; It is as though all
nature were holding her breath to wait the coming of the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the lake freezes over, when the ice holds,&rdquo;
we have a habit of saying, and, looking across the uncertainties
of the shut-in time, when I shall not be able to use the boat and
when no one can cross over to me, I too am longing for the
ice.</p>
<p>The boat can no longer be left in the water.&nbsp; Any cold
morning would find it frozen in until spring.&nbsp; It must also
be turned every evening, lest it fill with snow in the night, so
I haul that heavy skiff out on the sand; and, sure enough, the
accident, so confidently predicted by my friends, came to pass,
for in the turning the boat slipped, and down it came, full
weight across my foot.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>I am
somewhat a judge of pain.&nbsp; I know quite a good deal about
suffering of one kind and another, but this hurt was something
special in the way of an agony.&nbsp; It turned me sick and
dizzy, and for several minutes I could only stand and gasp, while
the trees turned round and round against the sky.&nbsp; When
their whirling had slowed down a bit, and I had caught my breath,
I hobbled down to the edge of the lake, kicked a hole in the thin
ice with my good foot, and thrust the hurt one into the icy
water.&nbsp; Then I spoke aloud!&nbsp; I did not in the least
mean to say the words that came to my lips, no one could have
been more surprised than I when I heard them, but with my
horrified face turned up to the evening sky, and the
consciousness that there was no way in the world of getting help
if I were badly hurt, I said, &ldquo;Great God
Almighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking it over, I am inclined to believe that the
ejaculation was, after all, a prayer.</p>
<p>Knowing that I should probably not be able to walk for days, I
then hobbled to and fro from the house to the lake, filling every
pail and tub.&nbsp; Then I carried in as much wood as I could,
and at last took off my shoe.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>It was
a wicked-looking injury, a foot swollen, bruised, and
crushed.&nbsp; I blessed my little medicine chest, with its
bichloride and morphia tablets, its cotton and gauze, that made
the long hours of that night endurable.&nbsp; For more than a
week I did my housework with a knee on the seat of a chair that I
pushed along before me round the cabin and the porch.&nbsp; No
one came to the island, nor could I get far enough from the house
to call a passing boat.</p>
<p>One afternoon there was a great sound of chopping in the
narrows between this island and Blake&rsquo;s Point.&nbsp; I
called, but no one answered.&nbsp; Later I learned that Henry
Blake had left a herring net there and that it had frozen
in.&nbsp; But at that time I felt only the faintest interest in
whatever was going forward.&nbsp; They might have chopped a way
through to China and I would not have cared.</p>
<p>The long days dragged on, while my hurt foot slowly
healed.&nbsp; I may say here that it was never fully healed until
the following spring.&nbsp; I had always to keep it bandaged even
after it had ceased to pain and it was not until May that I could
forget that it had been injured.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>On the
eighth the calm weather broke in a day of wild winds and flying
clouds, when the waves rolled in on the shores, and the driftwood
pounded on the beaches.&nbsp; At evening, when the storm had
lulled, the lake looked like a wide expanse of crinkled lead
foil.</p>
<p>Next morning I waked to a bright blue day and dazzling
sunshine.&nbsp; At first I feared that I had been suddenly
deafened, the stillness so stopped my ears.&nbsp; Then I realized
what had happened.&nbsp; There was no sound of the moving
water.&nbsp; The ice had come!</p>
<p>The lake was a silver mirror that reflected every tree, every
bowlder, every floating cloud.&nbsp; The islands hung between two
skies, were lighted by two suns.&nbsp; An eagle, soaring over the
lake, saw his double far below, even to his white back, that
flashed in the sunlight when he wheeled.</p>
<p>In the glancing beauty of that morning my heart flung open all
her doors, my breath came quickly, and my spirit sang.&nbsp; For
the first time in my life I understood how frost and cold, how
ice and snow, can praise and magnify the Lord.</p>
<p>That evening the snow came, turning the <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>lake into a
vast white plain &ldquo;white as no fuller on earth could white
it,&rdquo; that lay without spot or wrinkle under the
Indian&rsquo;s Moon of the Snowshoes.</p>
<p>This was the ninth of the month.&nbsp; Then followed long,
silent days, when I read and sewed and dreamed, and forgot what
day of the week it was, or what time of the day, and wondered how
long it would be before someone could come over from the mainland
to tell me that the ice was safe to walk on.</p>
<p>Each afternoon I hobbled to the beach and paraded there,
according to agreement with Mary Blake, to let her see that I was
still alive.&nbsp; The rabbit came in and sat by the fire&mdash;a
queer, silent little companion.&nbsp; The red squirrel scampered
all over the outside of the house, peeping at me through the
windows, and whisking in at the open door to steal a potato or a
nut, when he thought my back was turned.&nbsp; Funny little
Rufus!&nbsp; He spent a long, hard-working day, stealing the
contents of a basket of frozen potatoes put out for his
amusement.&nbsp; For months afterward I found those potatoes,
hard as bullets, stuck in the crotches of the cedars all over the
island.</p>
<p>From the ninth to the nineteenth I saw no <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>one and heard
no voice.&nbsp; Then I descried two men walking across the
lake.&nbsp; They carried long poles, with which they struck the
ice ahead to test its thickness.&nbsp; Each stroke ran along the
ice to the shore, with the sound of iron ringing against
stone.&nbsp; I saw the stick fall some seconds before I heard the
noise.</p>
<p>I had never seen men walking across a lake before.&nbsp; I had
never realized that this lake would become a solid floor on which
men could walk.&nbsp; I shall never forget the excitement with
which I watched them do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Half an
hour later Jimmie Dodd burst in, with red cheeks and shining
eyes, to tell me that the ice would hold.</p>
<p>The way to the farm being once more open, I made my Christmas
cake, mixing it here in the cabin and carrying it three quarters
of a mile across to the Blakes&rsquo; big oven.&nbsp; The
finished loaf came back over the ice, an excellent cake, as all
my Christmas visitors testified.</p>
<p>For let no one assume that because the inhabitants of this
island are few there has been no Christmas here.&nbsp; On the
contrary, the feast began on Christmas Eve and lasted for a
week.&nbsp; The tree, a young white pine, was cut on the island,
the trimmings came from Toronto, and great was the anxiety lest
the ice should not be strong enough to bear the wagon that
brought them over from Loon Lake Station.&nbsp; But the final
freeze came just in time, and we, the rabbit and I, spent happy
days tying on all the glittering trifles that go to the making of
that prettiest thing in the world&mdash;a Christmas tree.&nbsp;
There was a big gold star on the topmost twig.&nbsp; There were
oranges and boxes of candy for all invited and uninvited children
round the lake, and when all was finished, our <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>first visitor
was a storm-driven chickadee, that wandered in and stayed with
us, perched on a glittering branch.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve the Blakes came and had cake and coffee and
viewed the tree.&nbsp; On Christmas day, came the little
Beaulacs, from Loon Bay, some walking, some in arms, some dragged
in a big wooden box over the ice, and were refreshed with tea and
bread and butter and cake, after which they sat round the tree,
regarding it with great eyes of wonder.&nbsp; Next day the Forets
came to help me eat the Christmas duck and tinned plum pudding,
and after them the Big John Beaulacs, from far back of Sark.</p>
<p>So it went, with a party every day, while the brave little
tree stood glowing and twinkling at us all.&nbsp; It was
interesting to note how many errands the men found to bring them
to the island while the Christmas tree was standing, and how
their heavy faces lightened at sight of it.&nbsp; Surely it
fulfilled its purpose, sending out messages of good will and
friendliness and the love of God from the feather tip of each
tiniest twig.</p>
<p>At midnight on Christmas Eve I went out on the porch and
walked to and fro there in <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the biting cold.&nbsp; The rabbit,
that had been sleeping, a bunch of snow-white fur, on the
woodpile, hopped down and followed at my heels.&nbsp; The lake
was a shield of frosted silver.&nbsp; The moon shone bright as
day.&nbsp; One great star blazed over the shoulder of the
opposite island&mdash;it might have been the very star of
Bethlehem.&nbsp; So diamond clear was the air, so near leaned the
sky, that I might almost have reached and touched that
star.&nbsp; The night was so white, so still that I fancied I
could almost hear the angels&rsquo; song, and in the rainbow
glory of the moonlight could catch swift glimpses of the flashing
of their wings.</p>
<p>We walked there, the rabbit and I, until the cold drove me in,
to sleep beside the tree and dream of a procession of little
Beaulacs, creeping over the ice, each one with a star in his
hand.</p>
<h2><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Beaulacs belong to a tribe of
French Canadians that has peopled half the countryside.&nbsp;
They have various nicknames&mdash;Black Jack, Little Joe, Yankee
Jim, Big John, Rose Marie, Marie John, and so on.&nbsp; The
Little Jack Beaulacs live at Loon Bay, round the point and three
miles away.&nbsp; The road to Loon Lake Station starts at their
landing.&nbsp; They live in a barn, a sixteen-by-twenty-foot log
structure, banked with earth to keep out the cold.&nbsp; In its
one room, along with a double bed, a cooking stove, table,
sideboard, sewing machine, rocking chair, boxes, pots and pans,
and a clutter of harness and old junk of all kinds, live John and
Rose and the six young Beaulacs, beginning with sixteen-year-old
Louis and ending with the baby.&nbsp; There is one door and a
small window, that, so far as I know, has never been
opened.&nbsp; In summer, when the door is left ajar, the room is
apt to be further inhabited by hens, ducks, cats, and even a lamb
or two.</p>
<p>The house stands in a clearing on a <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>perfectly bare hill, but in summer,
the whole slope is golden with sheets of tansy, and the small
dug-out milk house is shaded by a giant lilac bush, sole remnant
of some long-forgotten garden.&nbsp; At the foot of the hill,
rotting, flat-bottomed boats wallow in the mud, and there the
little Beaulacs spend happy days fishing for mudcats, wading for
frogs, screaming, wrangling, and throwing stones into the
water.</p>
<p>They have not always lived in a barn.&nbsp; They have had two
other houses, each burned to the ground, with all the pitiful
furnishings it contained&mdash;crushing blows to people as poor
as the Beaulacs.&nbsp; After the last fire they moved into the
barn, the only shelter left standing, intending to build again in
the spring.&nbsp; But log-hauling is work, building materials
cost money, and time went on.&nbsp; Now they have settled down
contentedly in the barn, and will stay there, I doubt not, until
this roof falls down about their heads.&nbsp; They have no fear
of another fire.&nbsp; That would be impossible, for, as one of
the children tells me, the last one happened on the full of the
moon&mdash;sure sign that they can never be burned out again.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Like
other men of the settlement, John Beaulac works at the mica mine,
hunts, fishes, and farms a bit.&nbsp; Rose walks barefoot over
the fields, after the plow, digs the small garden, raises
chickens, picks wild berries, and sells frogs to the summer
campers, contriving thus to supply the few clothes and groceries
needed.&nbsp; For the rest, they live a happy, carefree life in
the open, and the young Beaulacs scramble up somehow.</p>
<p>Rose handles the boxes of supplies that come from Toronto for
the island, driving them in from Loon Lake and bringing them
across the lake by wagon or boat, as the time of the year
permits.&nbsp; Last time she refused, very firmly, to allow me to
pay for that hauling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to tax you
nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>When I expostulated, she only shook her frowsy head more
violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we do it fer you fer
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t like you had a man here to do
fer you,&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>
<p>Then she looked at her own man with pride and at me with a
vast pity, because I had no man to work myself to death for.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>In a
pioneer neighborhood, where every woman must have some man,
however worthless, to hew the wood and care for the stock, and
where every man must have some woman, to cook and to keep the
house, however lazy a slattern she may be, I, who live alone, pay
for my wood and draw the water, must be a creature not to be
understood.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Beaulacs invited me to go with them to the races
in Henderson&rsquo;s Bay&mdash;a trying out of the neighborhood
horses before the yearly races to be held at Queensport next
week.&nbsp; Scrambling and falling down the slippery trail, in
answer to their halloo, I found a straw-filled wagon body set on
runners and drawn by Beaulac&rsquo;s old mare.&nbsp; She, not
having been &ldquo;sharp shod,&rdquo; slipped and slid,
threatening to break a leg at every step, while the wagon slewed
from side to side over the ice.&nbsp; It was the first time that
I had driven over a lake.&nbsp; My heart was in my mouth all the
way.</p>
<p>Henderson&rsquo;s Bay, a long arm of Many Islands, stretches
for a mile into the land.&nbsp; It is a beautiful horseshoe, with
the farm house at the toe.&nbsp; The course was laid out on the
dull green ice, little cedar bushes set up to mark <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the quarter
miles.&nbsp; An old reaper, frozen in near the shore, served as
the judges&rsquo; stand.</p>
<p>We drew up at the side of the track, in the lee of a high rock
that somewhat sheltered us from the piercing wind.&nbsp; It was a
friendly scene.&nbsp; The encircling arms of the shore stretched
round and seemed to gather us close.&nbsp; The smoke from the
house chimneys curled up to the low-leaning gray sky, and
Henderson&rsquo;s herd, led by a dignified old bull, strolled
down over the hill as though to see the race.&nbsp; Far away on
the ice, black spots appeared, later discerned to be fast-moving
buggies, sleighs, and wagons coming to the meet.&nbsp; When they
were all assembled there must have been as many as seven
vehicles.&nbsp; There were four horses to be tried.&nbsp; They
were harnessed in turn to a little two-wheeled affair called a
bike.&nbsp; There is only one &ldquo;bike&rdquo; here, so no two
horses could run at a time, and there had to be a great
unhitching and harnessing again after every trial of speed.&nbsp;
Joe Boggs, the neighborhood jockey, drove with arms and legs all
spraddled out, like a spider, and urged on his poor steeds with
wild cries of: &ldquo;Hi-hi-hi-hi&rdquo;&mdash;enough to frighten
a sensible horse to death.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>I have
never beheld a more professional looking horseman than Mr.
Boggs.&nbsp; His disreputable old squirrel-skin cap, that hung
off the back of his head, his high boots, the bow of his legs,
the squint of his eye, even the way he chewed a straw between
races, bespoke the true jockey.&nbsp; One felt that if Joe Boggs
could not put a horse over the track, no one could.</p>
<p>Rose Beaulac too was a keen judge of a horse.&nbsp; She
criticized the entries unsparingly&mdash;Rose, with her long,
dry-looking coon skin coat, and her dirty red &ldquo;tuque&rdquo;
cocked over one eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old mare,&rdquo; she would say, cuttingly,
&ldquo;I knowed her in her best days, and then she wasn&rsquo;t
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled the mare for us.&nbsp; Our money was not on
her.</p>
<p>There was, however, one horse that she did consider worth
praise.&nbsp; She told me with awe that his owner had refused
four hundred dollars for him&mdash;a staggering sum.&nbsp; So
valued was this animal that he was not to be allowed to run any
more until the Queensport races, but when it was learned that I
wished to admire him, his owner consented to put him once round
the course, for my pleasure.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>After
the contestants had each done his best&mdash;or worst&mdash;the
meet broke up, with many &ldquo;Good-days&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Come-overs,&rdquo; and we drove back over the ice, the old
mare plunging and sliding along seemingly quite accustomed to
being driven, at a gallop, over a sheet of glass.</p>
<p>The eye swept the outline of the shore on which stand the
seven homesteads of this arm of the lake.&nbsp; Each roof
shelters a family of a different race and creed.&nbsp; Many
Islands is a type of the whole of this strong, young country,
that takes in men of all lands and minds, gives them her fertile
prairies almost for the asking, and makes them over into good
Canadians.</p>
<p>There are the Blakes, from &ldquo;The States,&rdquo; and
aggressively American; the Jacksons, Canadian born and Methodist;
the Hendersons, English and Church of England; the McDougals,
Scotch and Presbyterian; the Cassidys, Irish and Catholic; Harry
Sprig-gins, a sharp-faced little London cockney; and the
Beaulacs, true French Canadian.&nbsp; Once in a while a Swede
wanders in and hires out for the wood-cutting, or an Indian comes
along through the lakes in his canoe, and camps for awhile on one
of the islands.&nbsp; Amid <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>all the differences of belief and the
clash of temperament, the people manage to be friendly and
neighborly; the children play together; the young folk marry, and
the next generation is all Canadian.</p>
<p>They all speak English, but when one stops to listen, literal
translations of idioms and queer turns of phrase stand out.&nbsp;
Foret always speaks of a &ldquo;little, small&rdquo; bird or tree
or what not, and for him things are always &ldquo;perfectly all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yer moind thot pig, I sold Black Jack?&rdquo; asks
Uncle Dan Cassidy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow har you to-d&rsquo;y?&rdquo; inquires Harry
Spriggins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not too bad,&rdquo; answers John Beaulac.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Pas trop mal</i>,&rdquo; he is saying, of course.</p>
<p>When John has finished a job he stands off, hands in pockets,
and observes: &ldquo;That iss now ahl bunkum sah.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a moment&rsquo;s pondering one knows that &ldquo;<i>Bon
comme &ccedil;a</i>&rdquo; is what he means.</p>
<p>They speak of coming home through the
&ldquo;Brooly.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the scrub wood through which
a forest fire once swept.&nbsp; It is the land
&ldquo;brul&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;burned over.&nbsp; While they
live in Canada their talk is of far away lands, and it <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>is to the
&ldquo;Old Country&rdquo; that they mean to return some day.</p>
<p>And from the house on the island I see the life go
by&mdash;the stern, bare life of the country&mdash;with its
never-ending toil, its uncounted sacrifices, its feuds, its ready
charities and the piteous, unnecessary sufferings of the
sick.&nbsp; Blessed be the rural telephone, lately come to Many
Islands, that has made it possible for Dr. LeBaron to reach a
patient the day he is called.&nbsp; Thrice blessed the tinkle of
those little bells that bring the voices of the world to the
farms, shut in behind the snowdrifts.&nbsp; To the women, dulled
with labor and shaken with loneliness, they are the little bells
of courage.</p>
<p>I stopped at a farm the other day&mdash;a very lonely
place.&nbsp; Scarce were the first greetings over when the young
mistress of the house said, proudly: &ldquo;We have the telephone
here.&nbsp; Would you care to talk to any of your
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in her tone, the eager shining of her eyes, brought
a rush of tears to my own.&nbsp; It was the supreme effort of
hospitality.&nbsp; She was offering me the thing that had meant
life itself to her, the dear privilege of speaking with a
friend.</p>

95</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are at the very heart of winter
now.&nbsp; It is &ldquo;<i>le grand fr&ecirc;te</i>,&rdquo; that
I have been secretly dreading, and all my ideas of it are
changing as the quiet days go on.&nbsp; Winter in the woods has
always seemed to me the dead time&mdash;the season of darkness
and loneliness and loss.&nbsp; I find it only the pause before
the birth of a new year.&nbsp; If I break off a twig, it is green
at the heart, when I brush away the snow, the moss springs green
beneath it.&nbsp; Close against the breast of the meadow lie the
steadfast, evergreen rosettes of the plantain, sorrel, moth
mullen, and evening primrose, waiting in patience for the melting
of the snow.&nbsp; I never dip a pail into the hole in the ice
without bringing up a long trailer of green waterweed, or a
darting, flitting little whirligig beetle&mdash;the
gyrinus&mdash;somewhat less lively than in summer, to be sure,
but still active and alert.&nbsp; There is a big, fresh-water
clam lying at the bottom of the waterhole.&nbsp; He breathes and
palpitates, lolling out a soft pink body from the lips of a
half-open shell.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Yes,
winter here is only a slumber, and everything is stirring in its
sleep.&nbsp; They all proclaim again the old, old covenant, made
with the perpetual generations, that promise of the sure return
of seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and
day and night, that shall not cease while the earth remains.</p>
<p>The colors of winter are slate-blue and gray, laid on a
background of black and white.&nbsp; The chickadees and
nuthatches wear them&mdash;black velvet caps, gray coats, white
waistcoats.&nbsp; In the mornings long, slate-blue shadows
stretch away from the points of all the islands, and every
smallest standing weed casts its tiny blue shadow across the
snow.&nbsp; The ice is darkly iridescent, like the blue
pigeon&rsquo;s neck and head.</p>
<p>The dawns come late, the sunsets early, and in the twilight
the mice steal out from the woods and climb up and down on the
window screens, little misty, gray blurs moving swiftly against
the soft, gray dusk.</p>
<p>Through the long evenings, when supper is over, the curtains
drawn and the long sides of the big box stove glowing red, I read
and think and dream.&nbsp; All the while the timbers of the <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>house crack
and snap with the cold, the trees twist and creak in the wind,
and the ice groans and mutters.&nbsp; Now and again it gives a
long sigh, as though some heavy animal were imprisoned under it
and were struggling to escape.&nbsp; I imagine him heaving at it
with a great shoulder, grunting as he pushes, and sinking back to
rest before pushing again.&nbsp; Late in the night comes a long
roar, as though the beast had broken forth and were calling to
his mate.</p>

</a>Most people undress to go to bed.&nbsp; Here I undress and
dress again, putting on heaviest woolen underwear, long knit
stockings, flannel gown and sweater over all.&nbsp; I creep into
<a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>bed and
lie between flannel sheets and under piled blankets, and throw a
fur coat across the foot, in preparation for that first hurried
dash across the room at dawn.</p>
<p>There is only one anguished moment in the twenty-four
hours.&nbsp; It is when the fire has burned out, and the cold
wakes me.&nbsp; My movements then are reduced to the least
possible number.&nbsp; Almost with one motion I spring out of
bed, fling the window shut, tear back the whole top of the stove,
throw in fresh logs, put on the coffeepot, then skurry back to
bed to doze until the cabin is warm.</p>
<p>There is not the least trouble about keeping my stores
cool.&nbsp; The problem is to prevent their freezing.&nbsp; The
potatoes and eggs freeze in the very room with me, a pot of soup,
set in the outer vestibule, is a hard block from which I crack a
piece with the ax when I wish a hot supper.&nbsp; The condensed
milk is hard frozen, the canned plum puddings rattle about in
their tins like so many paving stones, and it takes all day to
heat them.&nbsp; Early in December, I laid a jagged bit of ice on
the corner of the porch, and there it lies, its shape quite
unchanged through weeks of bitter weather.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>There
is an inch or two of ice over the waterhole every morning.&nbsp;
When I go to fill the pails, I take the little ax along to chop
my cistern open, but gradually the walls of ice close in and
about once a week someone must cut me a fresh waterhole in
another spot on the lake.</p>
<p>The drying of the weekly wash is a most perplexing
thing.&nbsp; Clothes hung outside the house freeze immediately of
course.&nbsp; If they are hung inside, the room is filled with
their steam.&nbsp; My only plan is to heat the cabin red-hot,
hang them indoors, bank the fire for safety and take to the lake
or go a-visiting, for a certain number of clean clothes one must
have, if only to keep up one&rsquo;s self-respect.</p>
<p>This morning I woke so stiff with cold that I was almost
afraid to move in bed, lest a frozen finger or toe should drop
off.&nbsp; There was no more sleep, so, cowering over the stove,
I watched the sunrise, more augustly beautiful than I have ever
seen it.&nbsp; The bright crescent of last month&rsquo;s moon
hung, point downward, on a sky of mouse-gray velvet.&nbsp; Over
it stood the morning star.&nbsp; Along the eastern horizon lay a
line of soft brightness, that glowed through a veil of gray
gauze.&nbsp; <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Very slowly this bright line widened while the snow
field grew slate-blue, then purple, and the jagged tree line of
the forest stood out in silhouette, black pines, cedars, and
hemlocks against a yellow sky.&nbsp; Trees and bushes near at
hand stole out from the shadows, patterns of black lace against
the white ground, and sharply visible.&nbsp; The horizon line was
now tinged with red, the sky was changing to a tender
yellow-gray, shading to pale green as it neared the zenith.&nbsp;
The paling moon hung now against a background of rose and
saffron.&nbsp; The star still blazed above it like a lamp, until,
suddenly, a fiery streak appeared on the horizon, and star and
moon faded away before the red disk of the sun.</p>
<p>Toward noon the cold was less intense, and I ventured out to
get some long-delayed mail at the farm.&nbsp; Not a bird was
abroad, not a rabbit track lay on the paths.&nbsp; In fur coat,
fur hood, and high rubber boots I plowed a way across the lake,
where the level snow, knee-high, drifted in over the tops of the
boots and formed an icy crust around my stockinged feet.&nbsp; At
the farm I learned that the thermometer at Loon Lake Station had
registered thirty-five degrees below zero at seven o&rsquo;clock
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>that
morning.&nbsp; Even then, in the sun, on the Blakes&rsquo; south
porch it stood at twenty below.</p>
<p>At home in the afternoon all my little pensioners were out to
greet me.&nbsp; The white-breasted nuthatch was clinging, head
down, on a birch pillar, his head, twisted back at a
neck-dislocating angle, showed his black cap perched over one
eye, and gave him an indescribably rakish, disreputable
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yank, yank,&rdquo; he observed, irritably, as though to
chide me for keeping him waiting so long for food.&nbsp; The air
was full of the plaintive winter notes of the chickadees.&nbsp;
Peter, the rabbit, was sitting hunched against the kitchen door,
a forlorn little figure.</p>
<p>The feeding of my live stock has become quite a large part of
the duty of each day.&nbsp; The rabbit waits at the door for his
slice of bread, and, if that door is left ajar, he is quite apt
to hop inside and help himself to anything he finds standing on
the hearth.&nbsp; The squirrel has his toast and cold potato on
the woodpile, the birds their crumbs.&nbsp; The bushes present a
very odd appearance, hung with bits of bacon rind for the
chickadees.</p>
<p>The other night there came another little boarder, in the
person of a very small deer <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>mouse, that slipped into the cabin
and fell down between the wire screen and the lower casement of
the north window.&nbsp; Between the netting and the window frame
there is space enough to make a very satisfactory runway for a
very tiny mouse, and there he cowered, peering at me, with
terrified, bright eyes.&nbsp; The window panes open in on hinges,
like a French casement, so my first impulse was to shut the upper
half and keep him prisoner, knowing that if he once ran at large
in the house I could never catch him, and that he would make
havoc among the stores.&nbsp; He looked so hungry, trembling
there, with his tiny, pink hands clasped on his breast, that I
dropped him down a bit of bacon.&nbsp; Then he shivered so
piteously that I dropped also a fluff of absorbent cotton, which
he seized and instantly made into a little Esquimeau hut.&nbsp;
This he placed in the corner best sheltered from the wind, turned
its door in toward the glass, and retired, closing that opening
with a bit of cotton, and I saw him no more by day.</p>
<p>A deer mouse is the prettiest little beast imaginable,
somewhat smaller than the house mouse, and with very large
eyes.&nbsp; His fur is dark brown, very soft and thick and with a
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>darker
streak along the spine.&nbsp; His breast is white, his legs white
too, ending in tiny pink paws with wee fingernails, the exact
size of the eye of a number five needle.&nbsp; His ears are long
and fringed with black, his head very much like the head of a
doe.&nbsp; He is nocturnal in habit, staying up in the morning
until after his breakfast and mine, then retiring for the day, to
come out at twilight and run up and down the window screen for
exercise.&nbsp; So long as I keep this window closed he
can&rsquo;t get out, and I can study him through the glass at my
leisure.</p>
<p>Who ever sees a deer mouse at home?&nbsp; Walking through the
stubble field one sometimes starts one, and away he goes like a
flash.&nbsp; Here I have this little wild thing living in my
house, apparently quite content.&nbsp; He shall stay as long as
he seems well and happy.&nbsp; When I think he is pining he shall
go free, but he is quite as well off in his little hut as he
would be in the cast-off vireo&rsquo;s nest that is, in all
probability, his winter home.&nbsp; Snow drifts in and covers it,
to be sure, but he seems snug and warm and is growing sleek and
fat on a diet of bacon and apple.</p>
<p>Since the coming of the ice I find that I <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>must keep
more cooked stores on hand, not only for myself and for the birds
and beasts, but for the frequent visitors that come driving up
the lake to the door.&nbsp; They race along the ice in sleighs
and buggies and stop at the island.&nbsp; When they come they
stay to the next meal, so there must be materials for a party
always ready.&nbsp; It is only fair to state that the rule works
quite as well the other way round, for I am always welcome to
drop in at any house near which I happen to be at meal
time.&nbsp; Any passing guest may draw his chair to the table and
partake of what is set thereon.&nbsp; No apologies are offered
for the food.&nbsp; It may be only a pot of tea and a biscuit,
but whatever it is you are welcome, and that, by your leave, is
hospitality.</p>
<p>Oh, Many Islands, place of the good neighbors!&nbsp; I close
my eyes to see picture after picture passing across the screen of
memory.&nbsp; There is Henry Blake giving his time and labor that
my house may be warm and weather proof; there is Mary Blake with
daily gifts of good things to eat and counsel for my
inexperience.&nbsp; I see the little fishing boats bobbing
against the rocks as the men stop at the island to throw me off a
bass and some silver herring <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>as they pass with the day&rsquo;s
catch.&nbsp; There are John Beaulac&rsquo;s two little girls
scrambling through the bushes to bring me some venison when
father has killed a deer, and I see Anna Jackson putting a big
jug of maple syrup in the sleigh that brings me home on a
Sunday.</p>
<p>I see too Granny Drapeau&rsquo;s earnest old face, as I hear
her say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, but I was feared for you last night, when the wind
blowed so strong.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep fer thinkin&rsquo;
of you, all alone on that island.&nbsp; Come daylight I says to
Andy, &lsquo;Look over an&rsquo; tell if you kin see her
smoke.&rsquo;&nbsp; For if ever that smoke is not
a&rsquo;risin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll send one of the men over to see
what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daily kindnesses, daily acts of friendliness for the stranger
woman, who came from nowhere, to stay awhile and will go away,
they know not where.</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> the twenty-second was a
great day in the county.&nbsp; It was the date of the &ldquo;Tea
Meeting,&rdquo; given under the auspices of the English Church,
for the benefit of the destitute Belgians.&nbsp; It was also a
great day for me, being the first and the last time that I shall
appear in Many Islands&rsquo; society, when society meets at
night.&nbsp; To drive seven miles in the bitter cold, to return
to a stone cold house in the middle of the night, requires a love
of foregathering with one&rsquo;s fellows that I do not
possess.&nbsp; So not until I have trained the rabbit to keep up
the fire shall I venture out at night again.&nbsp; I had been
invited to the festivity by Mrs. Jackson weeks before.&nbsp;
Having very little notion of the proper dress for such an
occasion, I ventured to ask counsel of a young visitor who
dropped in opportunely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the women wear to the Tea Meetings here?&rdquo;
I inquired.</p>
<p>She surveyed me with an appraising eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
now,&rdquo; she said, kindly, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you a nice,
dark waist here with you?&nbsp; A lady of <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>your age
would naturally wear something dark and plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once I cast away all idea of a serviceably plain attire and
determined to array myself in all the finery I had with me here;
chiffon gown, long gloves and velvet hat with plumes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lady of my age, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when I arrived at the entertainment every soul was in her
best, and my attire entirely appropriate.&nbsp; I waited with
some pleasant anticipation for the moment when my little friend
should spy me and was not disappointed in the expression that
swept across her pretty face.&nbsp; As a plain dresser I was
evidently not a success.</p>
<p>The start was to be an early one.&nbsp; In the middle of the
afternoon I raked out the fire, fed the animals, hid the key
under the woodpile and started down the lake to the Jackson farm,
following a fresh-cut sleigh track that glittered like a silver
ribbon flung down on the blue ice.&nbsp; Now and again the solid
floor under me would give a groan and a heave and I would spring
aside, my heart in my throat despite my knowledge of the two feet
of solid ice beneath me.&nbsp; Then I would assure my quaking
spirit that where the woodsleds could <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>drive I could surely walk, and would
travel on.</p>
<p>At Jackson&rsquo;s there was a pot of bean soup on the stove,
and, as a comforting repast on a cold day, I know of nothing that
approaches hot bean soup&mdash;it stays by one.&nbsp; We drove
off in the big farm sleigh, seven miles to the town of Fallen
Timber, passing through Sark with its five houses and the Cheese
Factory, and by farms each of which contributed its heavily laden
sleigh to the long line of vehicles bound for the meeting.</p>
<p>The town hall of Fallen Timber stands on a bleak
hillside.&nbsp; It is a room, about thirty by forty feet in size,
with a six-foot wide stage at the end and a box stove in the
middle.&nbsp; The stovepipe goes straight to the ceiling, across,
and out by a hole in the wall at the back of the stage.&nbsp; The
walls are of a dirty, leprous-looking plaster, with here and
there a small bunch of ground pine tacked on by way of
decoration.&nbsp; At the back of the stage a strip of once white
muslin bore the inscription: &ldquo;Welcome To All&rdquo; in
letters a foot high.</p>
<p>The seats are planks laid on the stumps of trees, the stage
curtain is of red and green calico.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Now
and again this curtain was pushed aside, disclosing the
preparations for supper, and such piles of cookies, cakes, and
sandwiches I never expect to see again.&nbsp; In the phrase of
this neighborhood there were certainly &ldquo;plenty of
cookings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great folk of the evening were late&mdash;the rector and
his wife, the member of Parliament, who was to preside for us,
and the orator, who was to address us.&nbsp; But we did not mind
the delay.&nbsp; We had come to meet each other, and the time
passed pleasantly enough.&nbsp; I was seated almost exactly on
the stove, ventilation there was none, and the hall was packed,
but what of that?&nbsp; It was good to feel thoroughly warm, at
no expense to oneself, and there&rsquo;s too much fuss made about
fresh air anyway&mdash;at least in the opinion of many of my
neighbors.</p>
<p>The orator was the typical political speaker&mdash;portly,
bland, slightly humorous and very approachable.&nbsp; He made an
excellent speech, outlining the causes that led to the Great War,
and telling of Germany&rsquo;s policy and her hopes.&nbsp; He
explained the part that Belgium had played, in holding back the
tide of invasion until France had had time to mobilize, <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>and it was
all very clear and convincing.&nbsp; He laid stress on the
spontaneous outpouring of loyalty in the colonies, and quoted one
of the first messages received from India&mdash;the telegram from
a Rajah that read: &ldquo;My Emperor, what work has he for <span
class="GutSmall">ME</span> and for my-people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he went on to enumerate them&mdash;Canada, India,
Australia, New Zealand and all the islands of the seas&mdash;I
forgot the little hall, the crowd, the heat, and caught something
of Isaiah&rsquo;s vision of the Great House of God, that shall be
exalted high above the hills, and of the time when all nations
shall flow unto it.</p>
<p>After the speech came supper, huge plates of sandwiches and
many kinds of cake, with pitchers of steaming tea.&nbsp; The men
ate three and four of these platefuls with as careless an air as
who should say: &ldquo;What are five pounds or so of food washed
down with quarts of strong, boiled tea?&nbsp; A mere
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was worse, the children ate quite as much as their
elders, but I have long since ceased to forebode anything for the
youth of this favored land.&nbsp; Apparently, they cannot be
harmed.</p>
<p>After supper, at about eleven-thirty, came <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>the real
object of the meeting&mdash;the entertainment by &ldquo;local
talent.&rdquo;&nbsp; It began with the chorus: &ldquo;Tramp,
tramp, tramp, the boys are marching.&rdquo;&nbsp; Followed then a
recitation, &ldquo;My Aunt Somebody&rsquo;s Custard
Pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was delivered in a coquettish, not to say soubrettish
manner by a little miss in a short white frock, and with a coral
ribbon wound round her curly, dark hair.&nbsp; Her assured manner
struck me and not pleasantly.&nbsp; Later I understood it.&nbsp;
She was &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; in charge of Number Six, better
known as the Woodchuck School.&nbsp; I am told that the Boards of
Education cannot keep these rural schools supplied, the girls
marry off so fast; and I can well believe it, judging by this
one.&nbsp; She was evidently the belle of the neighborhood.&nbsp;
In the comments that the boys were making all round me the other
girls were all very well, but &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; was easily
the favorite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good teacher,&rdquo; I heard one declare,
hoarsely fervent.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s did well by Number
Six.&nbsp; I could make out every word them children
spoke&rdquo;&mdash;a fact that really seemed to give him cause
for satisfaction.</p>
<p>The night wore on with drill after drill, song after song,
recitation after recitation.&nbsp; <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Despite my fatigue, I was
interested.&nbsp; As I watched the audience something took me by
the throat.&nbsp; It was somehow so pathetic.&nbsp; Those heavy
men, those work-worn women were not interested because their
children were being shown off.&nbsp; No indeed.&nbsp; They liked
the performance because it was just at their level, and that fact
threw a searchlight on the bare monotony of their lives.&nbsp; We
finished at about two o&rsquo;clock with &ldquo;Tipperary,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; and, as every national
anthem is an assault on the feelings and makes me cry, I sang and
wiped my eyes with the rest.</p>
<p>The night skies here are seldom black, like the skies of the
south, they are more often a soft, misty gray.&nbsp; The stars,
instead of being sharp little points of light, are big and
indistinct and furry.&nbsp; It is always light enough to see the
road, even at the dark of the moon.&nbsp; We drove along through
the bitter cold, Big John Beaulac&rsquo;s hired boy, Reginald,
standing in the back of the sleigh, by way of getting a lift
home.&nbsp; He was regretting, all the way, that some people had
not eaten all their &ldquo;cookings&rdquo; and that so much good
food had been wasted on the floor.&nbsp; I fancied that Reginald
<a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Bean
would fain have eaten even more than he did.</p>
<p>At the shore we dropped Mrs. Jackson and the three little
sleeping Jacksons, and drove on down the lake.&nbsp; At the
narrows I, being almost frozen to the seat of the sleigh,
insisted on being set down to walk, and took my way along the
side of the island, treading in the footprints that I had left in
the snow when I had set out&mdash;was it the day or the week
before?</p>
<p>I groped my way among the trees and along the trail to the
house, lighted a fire and looked at the clock.&nbsp; I had been
walking through the woods at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
and with as little concern as though it had been that hour of a
summer afternoon.</p>
<p>Then, as though to rebuke my temerity, I was frightened on the
lake the very next day.</p>
<p>I was walking briskly along on the ice, singing at the top of
my lungs, because just to be alive on a day when the air was so
cold and clean, the sky so blue and the snow crystals so
brilliant, was happiness, when I came full on a figure that
robbed the morning of its joy.</p>
<p>It was Ishmael Beaulac, the imbecile, shambling heavily
along.&nbsp; He spoke, then <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>turned and followed me some
distance, his air half menacing, half cringing, and I was
frightened, for I realized that for miles around there was no one
to come to my aid, if Ishmael should take it into his poor,
crazed brain to do me harm.&nbsp; But he wandered off again, and,
as I watched his bent figure shuffling away in the snow, I was
shaken with a great compassion.&nbsp; I have never seen a face so
marked with evil.&nbsp; Lined, swollen, and inflamed with some
loathsome eruption, the low, receding forehead, with coarse,
black hair growing almost to the line of the eyebrows, a wide,
loose-lipped mouth, and cunning shifty eyes&mdash;it is a face
that has haunted my dreams.</p>
<p>I asked Rose Beaulac about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John and I was a sayin&rsquo; that we&rsquo;d ought to
tell you about Ish,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that the
ice is come, likely he&rsquo;ll walk over to the island.&nbsp;
But don&rsquo;t you be afeared of him.&nbsp; Just make out like
you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to throw hot water on him an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor creature!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t needful to scald him,&rdquo; said Rose,
with an air of great cunning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always holds <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>my finger
in the water to see if it&rsquo;s cool enough afore I throws
it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s awful &rsquo;fraid of water, Ish is,&rdquo;
she observed, and remembering Ishmael&rsquo;s appearance I could
well believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you ever make over him,&rdquo; Rose
went on, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you ever feed him or you&rsquo;ll
have him there all the time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t leave any knives
or old boots around where he can git them.&nbsp; Ish don&rsquo;t
know nothin&rsquo; about money; he&rsquo;ll walk right past your
purse to steal a pair of old boots.&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t hurt
you&mdash;at least we don&rsquo;t think he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that his father, Old John, was cruel to
him,&rdquo; I ventured, with some diffidence, for Old John or
Devil Beaulac was Little John&rsquo;s own Uncle.</p>
<p>A look of distress flitted across Rose&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old John was a very severe man, very severe,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He treated Ishmael awful bad.&nbsp; He must
have hurted him very hard, for now when the men is teasin&rsquo;
him if one of them lifts an ax or a spade, and makes to run at
him, Ish goes perfectly wild.&nbsp; They say Old John used to hit
him on the head.&nbsp; That would make him so crazy-like,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Yes, poor Ish has had it awful hard,
there&rsquo;s none but will tell you that,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>The
neighbors are less reticent about old John.&nbsp; By their
account he was a man outside all law, a giant in strength and of
a fiendish cruelty.&nbsp; Finally his tyrannies grew intolerable,
and his sons set on him, beating him until he died.&nbsp; Then
they threw his body into an old mica pit, filled the pit with
stones and went their way.&nbsp; No one interfered.&nbsp; The old
man was thought to have earned his doom and the sons were never
brought to trial.&nbsp; But even now, when poor Ishmael&rsquo;s
fits of madness come upon him they say he goes to that pit and
throws great rocks into it, cursing the memory of his father.</p>
<p>Much of this may be untrue, but the story haunts me.&nbsp; In
the figure of this poor maniac, hurling his stones and shouting
impotent curses to the unheeding sky, I see a time when the earth
was young, when men dragged the offender out from the great
congregation and stoned him to death before the face of an angry
God.&nbsp; I marvel that in this place so near to civilization
such stories can still be told.</p>

117</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are no longer tenderfeet, the
rabbit and I.&nbsp; We have come through a blizzard.&nbsp; For
the better part of a week we have been &ldquo;denned in&rdquo;
along with the squirrels, chipmunks, coons, bobcats, and
bears.&nbsp; We have melted snow for drinking water, because the
drifts cut us off from the lake and buried the waterhole.&nbsp;
We have dug our firewood out from under a pile of wet
whiteness.&nbsp; The mouse came through safely too, although the
snow sifted in through the window screen, and covered him, house
and all.</p>
<p>The storm began on the second of February, in the
evening.&nbsp; All night long the wind howled with a violence
that threatened to lift the house bodily and deposit it out on
the lake.&nbsp; It searched out every crack and crevice, chilling
me to the bone.&nbsp; It wrenched and tore at the heavy wooden
shutters, it tossed and twisted the trees, every now and again
throwing one to the ground with a grinding crash.&nbsp; It
whistled, it moaned; and, with it came the snow, in blinding,
whirling gray clouds that <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>blotted out everything.&nbsp; The
lake was obscured, the outlines of the neighboring islands were
lost.&nbsp; I could see only a smother of drifting, dancing
flakes.</p>
<p>The day passed fairly well, for the mere necessity of keeping
up the fire was an occupation in itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said I to Peter, &ldquo;is the beginning
of the true Canadian winter.&nbsp; I hope it does not stay too
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter, having been born last summer, has had no experience of
any other winter.&nbsp; No memories of former blizzards troubled
him.&nbsp; He hoped that the bread would hold out.</p>
<p>At about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon Satan inspired
me to go out on the porch, to survey the prospect.&nbsp;
Immediately I smelled smoke.</p>
<p>Now, there is but one thing of which I have been afraid, and
that is fire.&nbsp; A blaze started here would inevitably sweep
the island and no one could stop it.&nbsp; I smelled tar paper
burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant thing it would be to borrow the
cherished summer camp of a friend and burn it down for her!&nbsp;
What a safe thing for oneself it would be to go to sleep in a <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>smoldering
house and have it break into flames in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sniffed and sniffed despairingly.&nbsp; I scrambled out into
the snow to examine the chimneys; I burrowed under the porch
floor to look at the foundations; I climbed the ladder to make
sure of the roof, and still that smell of burning tar
persisted.&nbsp; I had a horrible misgiving that there was fire
smoldering between the outer and the inner walls.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to get to the Blakes and tell
them of my fears.&nbsp; If Henry could assure me that there was
no way of a fire&rsquo;s starting, I would believe him and go to
bed content.&nbsp; If I had not that assurance, I should be
forced to sit up all night waiting to escape into the snow.&nbsp;
Whatever the weather I had to get to the farm; that was all I
could think of.</p>
<p>I dressed as warmly as I could and set forth, through the
drifts, to the edge of the island.&nbsp; I made fair progress
until I stepped off the land on to the lake.&nbsp; Then I began
to have some idea of what I, in my ignorance, had undertaken.</p>
<p>The lake was like the ocean done in snow.&nbsp; The wind had
piled great breakers of snow <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>one behind another, their crests
curled over at the top, exactly like the waves on a beach.&nbsp;
Only these breakers were curled over the opposite way.&nbsp; They
turned over toward the wind, not away from it.&nbsp; One long
ridge followed another with a deep, scooped out furrow to
windward.&nbsp; Looking down on the lake from the level of the
porch, these waves did not look very high.&nbsp; When I stepped
off into them they came up to my armpits.</p>
<p>Even then I had not sense to turn back; even then I had no
idea of any real danger.&nbsp; The wind was at my back.&nbsp; I
could feel it behind me like a wall, as I climbed through each
succeeding hillock of snow and out across the intervening three
or four yards of level ice.&nbsp; Wave followed wave, each
higher, deeper, more suffocating than the last.&nbsp; Sometimes I
could walk for a few feet on the top of a drift before sinking
into its depths.&nbsp; I scrambled, fell, rolled, crawled,
climbed, and thought that I should never reach the shore.&nbsp;
Counting helped me, as I pulled each foot up out of the clinging
mass and set it down a few inches nearer the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four,&rdquo; I said aloud, timing my
steps to the pounding of my laboring <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>heart.&nbsp; My breath was coming in
gasps, a pulse beat in my temples, my head swam, there was a
ringing in my ears as I plodded on, now with eyes shut.</p>
<p>A thin, washed out moon came out and looked through wisps of
ragged clouds.&nbsp; Its light served only to make the scene more
desolate, the distance from the shore more terrifying.&nbsp; The
only idea that remained in my stupified brain was that I must
somehow find strength to go on lifting heavy feet one after the
other; that I must struggle up from each fall, must breathe deep
and keep a quiet mind.</p>
<p>At last I reached the deeper drifts that fringed the shore,
skirted the hidden waterhole, found traces of the cattle tracks,
dragged myself along the path and finally stepped, with the very
last remnant of strength, up on the porch and into the warm
bright kitchen.&nbsp; When Mary Blake caught sight of me, she sat
down suddenly and said: &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not attempted to get to the water hole that day, but
had given the cattle melted snow.&nbsp; They had gone only as far
as the barn and henhouses.&nbsp; Even the house dog had stayed
indoors.</p>
<p>I gasped out my fears and Henry Blake <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>laughed at
them.&nbsp; There was no way, he said, for a fire to have started
and if one had caught, the house would have been flat to the
ground long before I had crossed the lake.</p>
<p>I heard him with disgust.&nbsp; If that was the way my panic
looked, it was high time for me to return to my home on the
island.&nbsp; I rose with much dignity and walked off to the
shore, before the Blakes had adjusted their minds to the
move.</p>
<p>This time the wind was in my face, making the going ten times
harder than before.&nbsp; About forty yards out from shore I
stopped and turned my back to the blast to catch my breath, and
there was Henry, dressed in his great fur coat, striding out
after me and looking for all the world like a bear on its hind
legs.</p>
<p>When I saw his thickset figure struggling against the gale it
seemed suddenly a hatefully inconsiderate thing to have brought
him away from his warm fire and out into the storm and I
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back, Mr. Blake.&nbsp; There is no fire.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t attempt to come after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Henry only stumped on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s nothing burning,&rdquo; he <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a long way more
worried about you than we are about the camp.&nbsp; You might get
confused and lose your life in this storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On he went ahead of me and I was thankful to follow humbly in
his footsteps.</p>
<p>We reached the house, and, as we stood in the warm room
fighting for breath, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake, there is some Scotch here.&nbsp; Will you
drink some?&rdquo; And Henry said he would.</p>
<p>After that I was content to stay indoors until he came with
the horses and broke the tracks through the island.</p>
<p>Such heaps of snow lay piled on the lake and in the woods that
it should have taken months for it to disappear; but in three
days there came a thaw and melted it all away.</p>
<p>The thaw came not a day too soon, for the sixteenth was the
time set for the long anticipated sawing bee at the farm.&nbsp;
During January Henry Blake and Jimmie had been felling trees and
dragging them to the house in preparation for the arrival of the
perambulating sawmill, that goes from farm to farm as soon as the
ice will hold.&nbsp; There was a pile of logs, ten feet high by
thirty feet long piled butt end <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>to in the dooryard.&nbsp; When a
farmer announces a bee his neighbors gather from far and near,
leaving their own work to help him put through the particular job
in hand.&nbsp; He is expected to attend their bees in
return.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s wife, who earns a high seat in
heaven if ever woman did, works for days beforehand, cooking for
the ten or a dozen hungry men who will come down on her for
dinner, supper and, perhaps, breakfast, with a night&rsquo;s
lodging thrown in.</p>
<p>Mary Blake had made bread of the lightest and finest, had
killed chickens, taken fish out of brine, and pork from the
barrel; had made cakes and pies; had brought out pickles and
preserves, and when I arrived she was creaming carrots and onions
and boiling the inevitable potatoes.</p>
<p>It was a cold, gray day, with the surface of the lake
awash.&nbsp; As I splashed my way through the water, ankle-deep
on the ice, I heard the saw, clear and high, like the note of a
violin.&nbsp; There were ten men working at the bee.&nbsp; The
little gasoline engine was drawn up on a bobsled at the kitchen
door, and even as early as ten o&rsquo;clock it had eaten out a
big hole in the side of the stack of logs.&nbsp; William <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Foret and
Jock McDougal were at the machine shoveling snow into the boiler,
William in a bright blue jersey and with a squirrel skin cap set
at an angle over his dark, eager face.&nbsp; Henry Blake was at
the wheel, to take the sawed-off chunks from the feeders and
throw them to the pile.&nbsp; The rhythm of his movements was
exact.&nbsp; A reach toward the wheel, a heave, a toss over his
shoulder to the ever-increasing pile of chunks and a return to
the wheel&mdash;all this at the rate of a chunk every three
seconds.&nbsp; This position, being the hardest work, is always
taken by the host at a bee.</p>
<p>Little John Beaulac, Tom Jackson and Uncle Dan Cassidy lifted
the logs and carried them to the saw, where Black Jack held them
against the blade.&nbsp; There were two or three extra men
standing ready to take up the work when one or more should be
exhausted.</p>
<p>In the midst of the fray a sleigh was sighted, far out on the
ice.&nbsp; It was bringing Jim McNally from far back of the mica
mine.&nbsp; He had heard of the bee and had come, at a venture,
for fear that Henry might be &ldquo;shorthanded.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
brought a pail of fresh eggs for Mary Blake and a great sack of
turnips.&nbsp; <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>There was a mighty skurry and mystery about slipping a
bag of salt fish under the seat of the sleigh, for him to find
when he reached home.</p>
<p>At half past eleven the men trooped in to dinner, with many
facetious remarks about the strength of their appetites and the
advisability of letting the dirtiest man wash first.</p>
<p>After a very short smoke time they were at work again and I
sat at the kitchen window, watching the saw bite through the big
logs.&nbsp; The men&rsquo;s rhythmic movements, the swift
interplay of the bright colors of their jerseys, the long scream
of the toothed blade, all lulled me to vacuity of mind.&nbsp;
Long after dark, when I was back at home, I could hear the sound
of the wheel coming across the lake.&nbsp; That song of the saw
tells me just where the mill is working for the day.&nbsp; Going
out on the porch I can tell whether the bee is at Blake&rsquo;s,
Drapeau&rsquo;s, Foret&rsquo;s or the mines.</p>
<p>The Blakes are very up to date in their use of the gasoline
engine.&nbsp; Many of the farmers still use the old treadmill,
where four teams of horses walk round and round all day, turning
the wheel.&nbsp; Invited to a bee at the Jacksons&rsquo;, the
other day, I took a camera along, <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>for a picture of the old tread will
soon be a treasured possession.&nbsp; The men had paused in their
work in the kindest way to allow themselves to be
&ldquo;took.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was walking, with great dignity, down
the slippery hillside, when a treacherous bit of ice was my
undoing.&nbsp; I fell and my demoralization was complete.</p>
<p>Camera flew one way, walking staff another, arms and legs
spread out to the four points of the compass, as I went shooting
down that hill.&nbsp; When I had gathered my scattered members
and my wits together, and was scrambling up with the foolish grin
of the newly fallen, I looked appealingly at the sawing gang,
expecting to hear the inevitable laugh.&nbsp; Not a face did I
see.&nbsp; Every man&rsquo;s back was turned.&nbsp; The picture
was taken amid a sounding silence.</p>
<p>Commenting on that display of good manners to Uncle Dan, I
said fervently: &ldquo;Never in my life did I see such perfect
breeding.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to help laughing when
anyone falls, but not one of those men smiled.&nbsp; I never
expected such politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan&rsquo;s Irish eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d ought to have heard what the b&rsquo;ys
said when you left,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Pondering that cryptic remark, I am inclined to think
that it is just as well that I do not know all that is being said
of me in the work gangs and around the kitchen fires of Many
Islands.</p>
<h2><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> do we know when the turn of the
year has come?&nbsp; The calendar gives March twenty-first as the
official birthday of spring, but that has nothing to do with
it.&nbsp; One February day will be all winter, hard frozen and
dreary, and on the next, quite suddenly, through some spirit line
of sense, a message will reach us that spring, her very self, is
on the way.&nbsp; After that, no matter how many days of sleet
and snow may follow, we know that for us the winter is past.</p>
<p>So it was yesterday, here on the island.&nbsp; With a mind
adjusted to the thought of weeks of snow and ice to come, I
stepped out of doors and into the spring.&nbsp; The air was balmy
as May, the sky a turquoise and the lake a pearl.&nbsp; The furry
gray buds of the poplars had puffed out in the night.&nbsp; The
three little fingers of the birches were swelling and
lengthening.&nbsp; Suddenly my eyes were dazzled by a flash of
bright blue light, and a magnificent jay darted through the air
and perched on the bare branch of a basswood.&nbsp; After the <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>small,
drab-hued chickadees and nuthatches, that jay looked as large as
an eagle.&nbsp; Then I looked at little Peter, and lo! he was
turning brown.&nbsp; The white hairs of his winter coat were
falling off, his spring jacket was showing through.</p>
<p>The ground under the trees is dusted over with myriads of
brown scales, chief among them the bird-shaped pods of the
birches, that carry two wee seeds under their pinions.&nbsp; In
the open the snow is gray with patches of briskly hopping snow
fleas that move along over the meadows at a lively rate.&nbsp;
The nature books tell me that these are insects that live in the
mosses and lichens, and that they come out on warm days for
exercise.&nbsp; They are exercising for dear life to-day.</p>
<p>Here and there on the white carpet are the fairy writings left
by the wind last night.&nbsp; It bent down the dry tips of the
sedges, and traced circles, bows, triangles, mystic runes that
look as though they meant great news, if one could only read
them.</p>
<p>But the snow still covers the ground.&nbsp; Rufus still
tunnels under it, shaking the crust violently when he goes in for
some hidden store of food.&nbsp; The rabbit roads, pressed hard
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>by
hundreds of small, skurrying feet, still run crisscross under the
cedars, and the heavy woodsleds still travel down the middle of
the lake, like giant caterpillars, crawling along.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p131.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>Behind the opposite island the men are cutting ice.&nbsp;
Uncle Dan stands at the side of a dark pool of open water, and
works away with a saw as tall as himself.&nbsp; The rectangular
blocks, two feet thick, slide up the inclined boards to the sleds
and are driven <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>off to the icehouses in preparation for the
summer&rsquo;s shipment of fish to the towns.&nbsp; They are
beautiful, those blocks of ice, so clear and clean and blue.</p>
<p>With the fine weather has come the news that the Rector of the
English Church and Mrs. Rector are coming to the island for a
visit.&nbsp; The island is in much excitement.&nbsp; Salt bacon
and potatoes do not seem just the right fare to offer guests so
important and who are coming from afar.&nbsp; My mind is set on
chicken, and the word has gone forth round the lake that
&ldquo;the English minister is coming and the woman on the island
wants a fowl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, all our turkeys, ducks, and chickens are fattened for the
fowl fair, held at Queensport in December, when the poultry
dealers from Toronto and Montreal, and even from &ldquo;The
States,&rdquo; go through the country buying up the stock.&nbsp;
The greater part of the yearly income of some of us depends on
the prices paid for the fowl.&nbsp; My only chance of having
chickens through the winter was to engage a neighbor to save me a
dozen young cockerels and to pay him for their feed, having them
killed as needed.&nbsp; I had long ago eaten all these chickens
and the prospect of getting any <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>more was slight.&nbsp; Even Rose
Beaulac, fertile in resource, could give me no hope.</p>
<p>I never found the chicken, but I had a visit from Rose the day
before the party.&nbsp; She told me that she had given John his
gun and had sent him up Loon Bay to shoot me some grouse.&nbsp;
Then the conversation languished.&nbsp; Rose is a very shy little
woman; it took her nearly an hour to come to the real point of
her call.&nbsp; She would not lay aside her coonskin coat, she
would not remove her dingy tuque; there she sat, struggling with
her errand.</p>
<p>At last it came out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might she bring the baby to be christened when the
Rector came?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then for another half hour she rambled on about people who
never had their babies christened and what a sin that was, and of
those who never registered their children&rsquo;s births, and how
those children could never inherit property.&nbsp; Once in a
while she said something about things &ldquo;not being
legal,&rdquo; until I was quite bewildered and do not know to
this day whether, in her opinion, the unbaptized or the
unregistered infant is not legal.&nbsp; But the upshot of it all
was that the youngest Beaulac was to be christened next day.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>The
hour set for service was two o&rsquo;clock, but such was Mrs.
Beaulac&rsquo;s determination not to be late that she and the
baby&rsquo;s eldest sister arrived at eleven.&nbsp; There was no
sign of the father, John Beaulac.&nbsp; There I had made my
mistake.&nbsp; I had let him know that a sponsor would be needed
and that he was expected to stand.&nbsp; So when the godfather
was demanded none could be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to Queensport with a load of wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy Drapeau, the baby&rsquo;s uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to Glen Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other uncles were off hunting at Loon Lake; Louis, the
eldest brother, had disappeared entirely.&nbsp; So when the time
came for sponsors, the Rector&rsquo;s wife and I had to stand,
and for this poor baby, whose father owns not one rod of ground,
and who is sheltered in a hovel built for the cattle, we gravely
renounced &ldquo;the vain pomp and glory of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And because, in my hurry, I had forgotten to
temper the water in the improvised font, the new little soldier
and servant of Christ yelled valiantly when the ice water touched
him.</p>
<p>It was a scene I shall not forget: the cabin, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>with its
bunk in one corner, its big stove at one end, the pots and pans
on the wall behind it; the tools; the fishing tackle and the
stores.&nbsp; The Rector, wearing white surplice and embroidered
stole, stood in the center of the room beside the white-covered
table that held the bowl of water and the Prayer Book.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Drapeau, the baby&rsquo;s grandmother, had crept
across the ice to witness the baptism, the first she had seen,
she said, in twenty years.</p>
<p>The meeting closed with tea and cake; then the christening
party withdrew, the little new Christian sleeping peacefully in
the wooden box in which his mother dragged him away over the
ice.</p>
<p>We three who were left settled to dinner and a long
afternoon&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; At teatime the Rector observed that
the Woodchuck School was a mere seven miles away, and that he
might as well have a service there while he was so near.&nbsp; So
we dashed away across the lake, used telephones freely to collect
a congregation, opened the school house, and, by the light of two
guttering candles, said our prayers, sang our hymns, and listened
to a simple, direct, and practical sermon.&nbsp; Back <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>across the
ice I drove in the flare of the northern lights, that made the
night almost as bright as day.</p>
<p>The Rector is a young man and an energetic one&mdash;and he
has need to be&mdash;for his parish covers much ground.&nbsp; It
extends from the church at Queensport, out to Godfrey&rsquo;s
Mills, fifteen miles away to the south, and back to Fallen
Timber, twelve miles to the north.&nbsp; Besides these three
churches he has four or five irregular stations in the
schoolhouses dotted about within the radius of his
activities.&nbsp; On Sunday mornings he teaches the Sunday school
at Queensport and holds service there; in the afternoon he drives
to the Mills, and has Sunday school and Evening Prayer, at night
there is service at Fallen Timber.&nbsp; Up and down the roads he
drives, day after day, visiting the sick, baptizing the children,
burying the dead.&nbsp; He consoles, admonishes, encourages; he
reproves our negligences, bears with our foolishnesses, and
somehow contrives to have patience with our ignorance.</p>
<p>Being a churchman to whom the decency and orthodoxy of
services are dear, it is hard for him to excuse our lax
ways.&nbsp; It gives him <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>genuine distress when we know no
better than to drape our flags over the cross, and his face is
set against the to us very pleasing decoration furnished by house
plants growing in tin cans and set upon the altar.&nbsp; When he
marches up the aisle and removes these attempts at ornament,
replaces the vases and the cross where they belong, we say
nothing.&nbsp; It is evident that we have made a mistake in our
zeal.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t try that again, but something else
that proves just as reprehensible.&nbsp; But we are
learning&mdash;the Rector sees to that.&nbsp; If only the Bishop
will let him stay, we shall be good churchmen after awhile.&nbsp;
But we say proudly and sorrowfully: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too good
for a small parish like this.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be moved to the
city soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only way the Rector spares himself is in the matter of
writing sermons.&nbsp; He confessed to me that he did not write
three new ones a week, but preached the same one at all three
churches, thereby reserving, I suppose, a few hours for
sleep.</p>
<p>And with all this unceasing effort&mdash;and the clergy of all
denominations work just as hard&mdash;there are families living
here round Many Islands that have never entered a church.&nbsp;
<a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>They are
as veritable heathen as any on the far frontier.&nbsp; There was
a death at a farm on the road to Loon Lake station last
week.&nbsp; The body was put into a rough box, thrust into a
shallow grave, and the work of the farm went straight on.&nbsp;
And the English rector, the Roman Catholic priest, the Methodist
preacher and the Presbyterian minister all live within a radius
of twenty miles.</p>
<p>Strange country, so civilized and so primitive, so close to
cities and so inaccessible.&nbsp; Strange people, at once so old
and so young, so instructed in vice and sorrow, and so ignorant
of the simplest teachings of life.&nbsp; Grown men and women in
body but children in mind, with children&rsquo;s virtues and with
adults&rsquo; sins.</p>

not seen the ground&mdash;only a great field of white so dazzling
that one understands the Indian&rsquo;s name for the March
moon.&nbsp; Verily, my own eyes tell me why it is the Moon of
Snowblindness.</p>
<p>The ice is still thick and clear, but the sun on its surface
and the moving water beneath are both wearing it away, slowly,
surely.&nbsp; There are clear pools on the lake at noon, and then
the crows come down and drink, marching to and fro, like files of
small, black-clad soldiers.&nbsp; They meet, and bow politely,
speak to each other singly or in groups, then line up and off
they go with hoarse caws.&nbsp; They look so important that they
might be plotting all sorts of villainies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out fer yerself,&rdquo; laughs Uncle Dan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the curse of the crows on yer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dire threat!&nbsp; What use to break one&rsquo;s back
planting the corn if one&rsquo;s evilly disposed neighbor can
call winged battalions of those black thieves to undo all a
man&rsquo;s work and bring him to penury?</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>The
snow is still thick in the woods, but on the hilltops and in the
open, bare patches of earth are beginning to show.&nbsp;
Peter&rsquo;s coat matches the ground exactly, being a sharply
mottled brown and white.&nbsp; Indeed, he never did turn entirely
white, like the wild hares in the woods.&nbsp; Even when his fur
was its snowiest there was always a brown, diamond-shaped patch
on his forehead, and, so far as I know, he was the only hare so
decorated.&nbsp; No matter how far from home he strayed, I could
always recognize him by his brown brand.</p>
<p>This simple life has its inconveniences.&nbsp; I was eating a
belated breakfast the other morning, when bells on the lake and
later a sleigh at the door announced a visitor.&nbsp; It was a
perfectly unknown man who informed me that he had been sent by
Mrs. Swanson to bring me to her house to spend the day.&nbsp; He
had to wait outside, in the piercing wind, until a hasty glance
round the combined sleeping, cooking, and reception room
reassured me as to its condition for the entrance of a
stranger.&nbsp; Then he sat beside the stove, pipe in hand, and
inspected me gravely while I prepared for the long drive down the
lake.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The
day was bright and blue and snapping cold.&nbsp; A point of light
flashed from every facet of the roughened ice.&nbsp; The horse
was fresh, the wind at our backs, and we fairly flew past
Jackson&rsquo;s, over the bare roads and out again on beautiful
Blue Bay, lying like a sapphire in its setting of silvered
shores.</p>
<p>The pony was a broncho, my companion told me, calling my
attention to a brand to prove it.&nbsp; He was all that, and a
tree-climbing broncho to boot, for soon we came to a
perpendicular bank as high as the side of a barn, and I was given
to understand that the pony was going to clamber straight up,
with the sleigh dangling at his heels.&nbsp; I left the vehicle
and scrambled up on my own feet, but the animal went up the side
of that hill like a cat at a wall, and without one second&rsquo;s
hesitation.</p>
<p>Arrived at the house I inquired of my hostess if my escort was
her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was only
Clarence Nutting, the hired man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently, &ldquo;hired man&rdquo; means something very
different here from what it has hitherto meant to me.&nbsp; It
means friend, protector, <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>helper, and member of the
family.&nbsp; Mrs. Swanson, Susie Dove, the hired girl, Clarence
Nutting, and I all dined together; after dinner we played
dominoes.&nbsp; When Clarence brought in the fresh eggs from the
barn he suggested: &ldquo;Better give Miss X some to take home
with her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later he invited me to come back, and
soon, to spend several days.</p>
<p>Through the long, sunny afternoon, we sat round the stove in
the pleasant best room, with its well-starched lace curtains,
each with a bunch of artificial roses sewed on its folds, its oak
sideboard decorated with rose-bordered cr&ecirc;pe paper napkins,
its crayon portraits and wonderful, hand-made hooked rugs.&nbsp;
We women had our crocheting, but little Susie sat very upright,
her small, work-roughened hands clasped on her plaid-covered
knees, her toes, in their shiny best shoes, just reaching the
floor, while Clarence played for us on his new graphophone.</p>
<p>Clarence, in his high boots, patched trousers, and flannel
shirt, handled his music box with the tenderness of a
lover.&nbsp; He dusted each record after using it, as carefully
as a mother powders a baby.&nbsp; As he played tune after tune, I
saw in that instrument, God <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>knows what of pleasures foregone,
and temptations put aside while he saved out of his meager wages
the price of that graphophone.&nbsp; He had discovered a way to
use the thorns from a hawthorn tree instead of wooden
needles.&nbsp; They gave a very soft and lovely tone.&nbsp; His
records were the usual collection sold with the machine&mdash;a
few dances, a few Negro dialects and songs, some good marches and
some hymns.&nbsp; After nearly a year of hearing no tunes at all,
I enjoyed them, every one.&nbsp; When the concert was over,
Clarence played: &ldquo;God be with you till we meet
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After tea came the sleigh and we drove home to the island,
this time in a blinding snowstorm.&nbsp; Conversation was not so
lively as in the morning.&nbsp; I was thinking of all the
evidences I see here of man&rsquo;s unquenchable thirst for
beauty and music and the pleasant things of life, that not the
most incessant toil nor hardest privation can ever wholly
destroy.&nbsp; I was remembering how I had gone over to the
Blakes&rsquo; to use the telephone one afternoon and had had to
wait for an hour because Clarence Nutting&rsquo;s new instrument
had come, and all the receivers on the line <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>were down
while he played it for the neighborhood.&nbsp; I thought of poor
Harry Spriggins&rsquo;s delight in a magazine, of Mary
Blake&rsquo;s habit of keeping a glass of fresh flowers in the
center of her table, of the time when Mrs. Drapeau, having no
white tablecloth, had spread a clean sheet over her table for
company, and of the Beaulacs&rsquo; joy in the blossoming of
their lilac bush.</p>
<p>Then I began dreaming of a big, comfortable shack somewhere on
the shore, to which the people could come, as to a common meeting
ground, social differences and local feuds forgotten.&nbsp; I saw
it furnished with a cupboard full of cups and plates, a piano or
victrola.&nbsp; There should be a circulating library there and
games, I decided, and I saw the boys and girls dancing, singing,
cooking popcorn, candy and fudge, in the evenings.&nbsp; I
imagined a group of women drinking tea and sewing while
&ldquo;teacher&rdquo; played.</p>
<p>A few days later I went with the Rector and Mrs. Rector to
drink tea with the wife of the owner of a big lumber mill, and
there I saw what one woman has done amid just such conditions as
are here at Many Islands.</p>
<p>There were the pretty little church, the <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>parish
house, the Sunday school room, all built by Mrs. Baring, and I
heard of the reading circles, the concerts, the cooking classes
that she has organized for the people among whom she has had to
live.</p>
<p>There too I saw the Canadian mother in war times and marveled
at her.&nbsp; Mrs. Baring has sent the light of her eyes, the
pride of her heart, the son who was winning honors at his
university and had a great future before him, overseas to the
trenches.&nbsp; I saw picture after picture of him&mdash;Harold
as a baby, as a child, as a boy, as a man.&nbsp; He was shown in
his little knickers, his first long trousers, his khaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is in France now, but of course we do not know
where,&rdquo; the mother said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I send him two pairs
of socks, some handkerchiefs and shirts every week.&nbsp; The
boys like that better than one large box occasionally&mdash;they
lose their clothes so.&nbsp; We hope that things reach him, but
we do not know.&nbsp; We have not heard from him for two months
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this without a tremor of the firm lips, with not the
shadow of a cloud over the serene blue eyes.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>The
Rector told me afterward that not once has that mother alluded to
the possibility of her son&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; She gave her
supreme gift without hope of any reward.&nbsp; Withal her
interest in affairs is as keen, her charities as wide, her
hospitality as gracious, as though she had never a care in the
world and her boy were safe at her side.</p>
<p>After supper we climbed over the slippery hillside to the
church for Evensong.&nbsp; Our hostess sat at the organ at the
side of the chancel and in full view of the congregation.&nbsp;
During the service I watched her calm, clear profile.&nbsp; She
went through the intolerably pathetic petitions of the Litany
without wavering, as we prayed for those who are fighting by land
and sea and air; for the prisoners, the wounded and the dying,
and her sweet, steady voice led our responses.&nbsp; Only once
did I see her falter.&nbsp; It was during the singing of the
hymn.&nbsp; Her pretty ringed fingers went on pressing the keys;
she played, but she could not sing.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The Son of God goes forth to war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A kingly crown to gain,<br />
His blood-red banner streams afar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who follows in his train?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Her
eyes looked past us, straight across the world.&nbsp; Her lips
were parted in a smile sadder than tears.&nbsp; She was shedding
her heart&rsquo;s blood, drop by drop, for the safety of the
empire.</p>
<p>We do not talk much about the Great War here at Many
Islands.&nbsp; Indeed, it is only when I go to the towns that I
realize that Canada is at war.&nbsp; Once in a while one of our
boys speaks of going to the front, and only the other day Andy
Drapeau was saying, &ldquo;Ef it comes to drafting, I&rsquo;ll
volunteer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fight of me own free will.&nbsp; No
man shall make me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that, Andy was merely talking.&nbsp; He had no idea of
enlisting.</p>
<p>No, as always, it is the men of the cities who will go first,
and the reason is not far to seek.&nbsp; It lies in the fact that
the bucolic mind is almost totally devoid of imagination&mdash;it
cannot picture what it has never seen.&nbsp; It can form no
vision of an empire.&nbsp; It can think of this county as part of
the Province and the Province as part of the Dominion, but of
Canada as part of a great federation it cannot conceive&mdash;the
thought is too big.&nbsp; Our vision is bounded by the limits of
our own <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>experience.&nbsp; We know that Britain, France, and
Russia are fighting Germany and Austria, but the fields of Europe
lie very far away, while our own fields are very near.</p>
<p>We all know Germans.&nbsp; We have worked beside them in the
hayfields and the mines.&nbsp; They seem good fellows enough, not
companionable because they speak an outlandish sort of lingo that
we doubt their being able to understand themselves.&nbsp; But why
should we fight them?&nbsp; Of the Hun we can form no idea, thank
God.&nbsp; He is outside our experience.</p>
<p>We have a patriotism, but it is local, parochial.&nbsp; If
this war were a baseball game between the rival teams of Sark and
Fallen Timber, we could understand it fast enough.&nbsp; We would
&ldquo;root&rdquo; for our side and, if need be, fight for
it.&nbsp; But the far-off struggle of nation with nation leaves
us cold.&nbsp; We cannot picture it.</p>
<p>But when the first wounded came back from the trenches, and
when the stories of Saint Julien and Festhubert were told at the
firesides, then went the men of rural Canada forward gladly to
fill the places of those heroes whose deaths are Canada&rsquo;s
undying glory.</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Appropriately</span> enough, on this first
day of the calendar spring, I am warned that the ice is unsafe
and that I must stay on the island until the lake is open
water.&nbsp; The natives still venture out, but they know the
look of the thin spots and even they are very cautious.&nbsp; Two
men started over from mainland this morning, axes on shoulder,
hounds at heel, but they turned back at the shore, and the dogs,
after stepping daintily on the dark, spongy crust, turned back
also.&nbsp; The middle of the lake is still hard, but there are
ditches of water round the edges of the land.&nbsp; The ice has
heaved up into long fissures stretching away from the points, the
clear green water showing between their open sides, and from this
island to the Blakes&rsquo; point there is a great crevasse.</p>
<p>Mary declares that she has known Henry to start off in a
sleigh over the lake when the ice was only three inches thick;
when he had to drive fast to keep from breaking in and when the
water spurted up from the holes <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>made by the horse&rsquo;s
hoofs.&nbsp; But Henry was going for the mail, and when he has
been deprived of news for two or three weeks, the papers become
things to risk one&rsquo;s life for&mdash;which is proof that
Henry will never be a true Many Islander.&nbsp; The rest of us
are quite willing to wait until spring, if need be.</p>
<p>So I am &ldquo;denned in&rdquo; once more, and before I am
free all sorts of things will have happened.&nbsp; There will be
hundreds of little new calves and lambs lying beside their
mothers in the meadows, and scores of thin-legged colts running
beside the mares in the pastures.&nbsp; I shall also be shut in
when the sap buckets hang in the &ldquo;sugar bush&rdquo; and the
great black kettles steam over the fires in the dooryards, and I
can only hope that some of my friends will remember to put my
name in the pot, and to save me some syrup and some maple
sugar.</p>
<p>Forced to take my exercise on the island, I find new things
everywhere, as I tramp round and round the trails.&nbsp; The snow
under the evergreens is covered with last year&rsquo;s dry
needles; the hemlocks, pines and cedars are putting on their new,
bright green fringes.&nbsp; Under the rotting leaves, innumerable
little new plants are pushing up, princess fern, wild <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>strawberry,
Canada mayflower, and countless other small weeds and herbs,
whose names I do not know.&nbsp; When the leaves and needles are
raked away each stalk is seen standing in a tiny pool of clear
ice.</p>
<p>The spring peepers are whistling in the lowlands, the hylodes
blows his little bagpipe, away in the wood the grouse is
&ldquo;beating his throbbing drum&rdquo;&mdash;no other
description fits that thrilling sound&mdash;and the first
honeybees are buzzing out from a clump of birches and winging
away over the lake.&nbsp; Underneath all the other spring sounds
is the measured &ldquo;tonk-tonk&rdquo; of the air escaping
through the holes in the ice, and the thin, silver sound of
trickling streams.</p>
<p>The red-headed woodpecker is here, his crown a spot of
splendid crimson against the snow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ker-r-ruck,
ker-r-ruck,&rdquo; he cries as he darts from tree to tree, his
white tail coverts flashing in the sunlight.</p>
<p>There has been a deer on the island.&nbsp; Through my dreams
one night I heard sounds of a great commotion, the cries of dogs,
the crashing of animals through the underbrush.&nbsp; In the
morning, not ten paces from the kitchen door, the snow was all
trampled, soiled and <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>covered with bunches of long brown
hair.&nbsp; Evidently, the place was the scene of the poor
animal&rsquo;s agony, for those hairs were soaked with blood.</p>
<p>I grieved, for I have liked to think that the island was a
place of refuge for all hunted things&mdash;at least for this one
year.&nbsp; But if the dogs had dragged down the deer and killed
him, what had become of the carcass?&nbsp; I wondered.&nbsp; They
could not have eaten it so clean that no trace of skin or bones
remained.&nbsp; I pondered this as I followed the deer&rsquo;s
small, shapely hoof-prints from the shore and up over the hill
and through the bushes all hung with bunches of tell-tale brown
hair.&nbsp; I traced the dogs&rsquo; tracks also, as they crossed
and recrossed the trail, and following them came to an old mica
pit, hidden far back among the cedars a gash in the hillside, ten
or twelve feet deep and four or five yards long, ringed round
with bushes and with a young birch growing in its depths.&nbsp;
Indeed, I fell headlong into that hidden pitfall, and had time to
hope, as I went down, scrambling over the edge and clutching at
branches, that I was not going to land full on a wounded
deer.</p>
<p>All tracks stopped at this pit, and the <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>mystery
remained a mystery until late in the spring, when it leaked out
that Andy and George Drapeau had heard the cries of the hounds,
had watched their chance, had come over, dragged off the dogs,
and skinned and carried away the deer.</p>
<p>Now the season for hunting deer lasts from November first to
November fifteenth.&nbsp; Only one deer may be shot by each
hunter.&nbsp; No hounds may be allowed to run at large during the
closed season and any dog found running a deer may be shot on
sight, and the person shooting this dog may not be
prosecuted.&nbsp; Thus the month of March is not the time for
fresh venison.&nbsp; Venison out of season is &ldquo;mountain
goat,&rdquo; to be eaten privately and without
boastfulness.&nbsp; Nor is it safe to display a deer&rsquo;s
spring coat.&nbsp; But if the Drapeaus had left me that hide,
would I have informed on their dogs?&nbsp; I wonder.</p>
<p>My own stupidity robbed me of the only other deerskin rug that
I might have had.&nbsp; Little John Beaulac offered me a
beautiful&mdash;and seasonable&mdash;one which I bought and sent
to the squaw at Maskinonge for tanning.&nbsp; Some weeks later I
mentioned my good fortune to William Foret.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;Are you having the hair left on?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hair left on!&rdquo; I echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course.&nbsp; I never heard of having the hair taken off.&nbsp; I
want the skin for a rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d ought to have said so,&rdquo; said
William.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mostly they tans them for leather round
here.&nbsp; They makes fine moccasins and mittens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, that Indian woman had patiently scraped off all
the hair and I received a superfine piece of buckskin, which was
presented to Little John, I having no use in the world for
moccasins or mittens when I should return to the city.</p>
<p>The Drapeaus live on a long peninsula to the west of this
island and half a mile away.&nbsp; From this dock I see their
barns in silhouette against the sunsets.&nbsp; Their land rises
in fold on fold of meadow, with here and there a clump of cedars
or maples, then a soft slope and slanting cornfield.&nbsp; Their
house is the typical Canadian log shack, a building about sixteen
by twenty feet, divided by a board partition into a kitchen and a
tiny bedroom.&nbsp; A trap door opens into the cellar; a ladder
leads up to the loft where the boys sleep.&nbsp; There <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>is a shed,
built at right angles to the south wall, and here Mrs. Drapeau
keeps her washtub, churn, and milk separator.&nbsp; The place is
always crowded with lounging men; the dogs are everywhere under
foot, and the air is thick with the smoke from many old
pipes.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Herring nets hang from the rafters, harness on the walls;
drying skins are stretched across the uprights.&nbsp; In the
muskrat season dozens of furry, brown rats are nailed, by their
tails, to the outside walls, and inside the house <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>great pails
of bloody water, piles of raw skins, and heaps of rats fill the
small room.</p>
<p>The Drapeaus believe in the division of labor, and the work of
the family seems portioned out in a thoroughly satisfactory
way.&nbsp; Andy, the eldest son, is the farmer, Lewis the hunter
and George the fisherman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Drapeau, though not an old woman, goes back to the early
days of the settlement and knows all the hardships of pioneer
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind the time,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;when this land
was all wilderness and when the bears and the wildcats come up to
the very door.&nbsp; Once I seen four bear start over across the
lake from Blake&rsquo;s point to your island.&nbsp; They swum
across the narrows, the old he-bear in the lead, the biggest of
the young next, then the little cub and the mother behind.&nbsp;
Me an&rsquo; the boys was in the boat&mdash;we had been a
berryin&rsquo;&mdash;and when the boys seen them bear they went
wild.&nbsp; They rowed up along the island after them, but they
couldn&rsquo;t go fast enough with me in the boat, so they landed
me and rowed along to head off the bear, an&rsquo; blest if they
didn&rsquo;t turn &rsquo;em right back along the shore to where I
was a sittin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I was right in their tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You come back here an&rsquo; git me,&rsquo; I
yelled, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&lsquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you do another trick like
that agin, the longest day you live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was I a-hollerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the boys
a-laughin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the bear a comin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Why, I
might &rsquo;a&rsquo; been kilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bears?&nbsp; Oh! they got away.&nbsp; What with me
a-screechin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the boys a shootin&rsquo; they was
so scared that they climbed off the far side of the island,
an&rsquo; the last we saw of them they was over to
Henderson&rsquo;s Bay, their heads just out of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Drapeau tells of the day when she and her husband came
over to their farm in a little flat-bottomed punt, a calf, the
beginning of their herd, tied foot to foot and bellowing in the
stern.&nbsp; It was a hard fight to clear the land and bring it
to some sort of cultivation, and in a few years Drapeau was
killed in a lumber camp, leaving her with four young children to
feed.&nbsp; She describes the long winter nights when she spun,
carded, and wove the cloth that kept their shivering little
bodies covered against the bitter cold, of the backbreaking days
in the fields when she hoed the potatoes and planted the corn,
that there might be food for the hungry mouths, and of <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>the long
months when she worked at the miners&rsquo; boarding house,
cooking and washing for a score of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could have done it if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
my neighbors,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They was awful good
to me.&nbsp; The men cut my wood every winter as come an&rsquo;
ketched me my fish until the boys was big enough to work.&nbsp;
Eh! but I did have the hardest time the year my man died.&nbsp;
Scarce was he laid in the ground when the two biggest boys come
back from the school at Loon Lake with the smallpox.&nbsp; George
and Andy had it and they had it fearful bad.&nbsp; I thought sure
the other two would have it too.&nbsp; The health doctor come up
all the way from Queensport an&rsquo; nailed a notice on my door,
tellin&rsquo; the neighbors to keep away, and he forbid me to
cross the lake, on fifty dollars fine.&nbsp; So there I was, the
ice just breakin&rsquo; and me shut in with my children that was
a dyin&rsquo;, as you might say.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to go
to no one&rsquo;s house, nor to have them come to mine, but I had
little or nothin&rsquo; to eat on the place, and I feared lest my
children should starve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I done the best I could, and one day, when the ice
was all broke, I heard Bill <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Shelly, the frogger, passin&rsquo;
in a boat.&nbsp; I hollered to him the fix I was in and told him
to fetch me some goods from the store an&rsquo; to tell my father
how we was shut in.&nbsp; Bill brung me the goods and we got
along some way, and when all was over an&rsquo; the boys was
well, here comes Robinson, the health doctor, to ask how we was
all gettin&rsquo; along.&nbsp; He stood off, twenty paces from
the door with his white handkerchief to his face.&nbsp; I was
minded to set the dogs on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come in?&rsquo;&nbsp; I
says, &lsquo;All&rsquo;s safe now.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t to be
afraid.&nbsp; You shut me in here, with my dyin&rsquo; children,
and not you ner no one else come anear me, not even to the shore,
to ask did I have so much as a hundred of flour to keep us
alive.&nbsp; How did you know we wasn&rsquo;t all starved
together?&nbsp; Get you off this land,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;fer
you haven&rsquo;t got the grace of God in yer heart.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He got off and I ain&rsquo;t seen him since, but I ain&rsquo;t
never fergot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this she tells me, sitting before the fire, her gray
woolen petticoat turned back over her knees, a black
three-cornered shawl laid over her head and pinned firmly under
her pointed chin, She was a beauty once.&nbsp; She is <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>a pretty
old woman still, with her flashing black eyes and silver
hair.&nbsp; Even now, at sixty odd, she milks seven cows, makes
all the butter and cheese, cares for the hens, the turkeys and
the pigs, works a small garden, cooks for the boys, nurses them
when they fall ill, and finds time to make wonderful patchwork
quilts.&nbsp; Mrs. Drapeau can tell the names of all the quilt
patterns known to Canada.</p>
<p>I love these patchwork quilts.&nbsp; They speak of thrift and
industry and patience, and of the leisure of a life in which
small bits of cloth are of more value than the time it takes to
stitch them together.&nbsp; Who in the cities has time nowadays
to sit and make a patchwork quilt?&nbsp; They bring up pictures
of bedfuls of little children, sleeping snug and warm under
mother&rsquo;s handiwork, and of contented women sewing in the
firelight.</p>
<p>Their names are poetry&mdash;woman&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; The
Log Cabin stands for home, the Churn Dasher is food, the Maple
Leaf means Canada.&nbsp; The Road to Dublin, and the Irish Chain
speak of the homesick Irish heart, but I like to imagine that the
Prairie Rose was named by some happy woman who loved the wide and
blossoming fields of this new land.</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Good Friday</span>, a heavy fall of snow
and winter come again.&nbsp; The ground is white, the sky dull
gray, the lake a dark, bluish green flecked with windrows of
snow.&nbsp; It is more than a week since I have walked on the
ice.&nbsp; It bids fair to be two weeks before I can cross in a
boat.&nbsp; At this rate the ice will never break&mdash;I had to
chop out the water hole again this morning.&nbsp; This waiting
for the ice to go out is like waiting for a child to be born, and
it seems almost as solemn.&nbsp; It induces a calm, philosophic,
not to say fatalistic, viewpoint.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t hurry it,
you can&rsquo;t stop it, you can&rsquo;t do anything at all about
it.&nbsp; You can only wait.</p>
<p>Again, as in the fall when the ice was forming, there is that
strange blanket of silence over the island.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
not a rustle in the dry leaves, not a bird&rsquo;s voice, not
even the scraping of a hanging bough.&nbsp; The ice field is
growing darker, wetter, and cracking into long lines that form
geometric figures&mdash;squares, triangles,
trapezoids&mdash;until the lake&rsquo;s surface looks like a
gigantic spider&rsquo;s web.&nbsp; For <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>movement
there is only the water along the shores, creeping up over the
stones.</p>
<p>The evening was cold and gray, with a rising wind that
whistled up the rain.&nbsp; In the night came both the former and
the latter rains and all other rains between; then Easter Day,
warm and blue and beautiful.&nbsp; As the Easter lesson sank into
my heart, along with the still beauty of sky and sun and waking
life, the first butterfly, emblem of the resurrection, came forth
from his winter sleeping place and fluttered to and fro among the
yellow tassels of the birches.</p>
<p>The years remaining may be many or few for me, but to
life&rsquo;s end I shall hope to keep some measure of the joy of
that one Easter day.&nbsp; I pray that I may always remember the
tender blue of the arching sky, the white of the wisps of
floating cloud, the gray purple of the spring haze lying over the
forests; its silence and its peace.&nbsp; Looking out over the
breaking ice, I remembered the story of two boys who lost their
lives in the lake only last summer.&nbsp; They were forlorn
little fellows, held in bondage by a stupid, tyrannical
father.&nbsp; They had never seen anything that boys
love&mdash;neither a circus, nor a picture, nor had ever heard a
band.&nbsp; <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>They had never been allowed to go even to Frontenac,
the county seat, ten miles away.&nbsp; All they knew about was
work and heavy sleep and now and then a beating.&nbsp; But they
were boys after all, and one bright day they slipped away from
the harvest field and went to the lake to go afishing.&nbsp;
Hearing footsteps and fearing their father&rsquo;s anger, they
tried to escape it.&nbsp; The younger boy jumped into a rotting
punt at the shore and pushed off on the water.&nbsp; The elder
hid behind a rock.</p>
<p>Out on the lake the old punt filled and began to sink.&nbsp;
The little fellow, seeing that he was going down and knowing that
he could not swim, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Charley; Good-by, good-by,&rdquo; his piping
child&rsquo;s voice sang over the water.</p>
<p>The elder boy heard him and plunged in to his aid.&nbsp; Both
went down, and when, at last, the grappling hooks brought up the
bodies, the brothers were locked in one another&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>A commonplace story, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Such accidents
happen almost every day&mdash;somewhere.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing at all in it but childish joy in freedom, dread of
punishment, terror, then love and sacrifice, and, crowning all,
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>heroic
death.&nbsp; I think of them not as &ldquo;saints in glory&rdquo;
but as happy youngsters, trudging, hand in hand the streets of
the Eternal City; seeing, hearing, tasting all the joys that life
denied them here.</p>
<p>Resigned to the thought of days and weeks of solitude, I was
surprised by the sound of a long halloo coming from the direction
of Blake&rsquo;s Point.</p>
<p>It was Henry, standing on the extreme end of his land and
calling over to me.&nbsp; His was the first voice I had heard for
days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down to your point,&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>Scrambling through the underbrush, sliding from rock to rock,
plowing through bogs, wading through patches of snow, I reached
the shore, to see Jimmie Dodd, trotting cautiously across the ice
dragging his little hand-sled, while Henry directed his way from
the point.&nbsp; The sled held loaves of bread, a pat of fresh
butter&mdash;a great bag of mail and a box of candy and
fruit&mdash;the Easter greeting from home.&nbsp; The water was
flowing all round the shore; Jimmie could not come within many
feet of the island, but I waded out on the shelving sand and
Jimmie crept as near the edge of the ice as he dared and tossed
the <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>bags
to me across the open water.&nbsp; Then he trotted back again to
the farm and I returned to the house to enjoy my feast alone.</p>
<p>Day followed day, slipping by swiftly, silently.&nbsp; The
first ph&oelig;be has come back and is twitching his tail and
screaming his &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be, ph&oelig;be,
ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; all day long.</p>
<p>Across the sky, in V-shaped wedges, the geese are flying
over.&nbsp; From ever so far I can hear their
&ldquo;honk-honk,&rdquo; telling me why the April moon is the
Goose moon.</p>
<p>The woodchuck, that lives in a hole by the sundial, comes out
and waddles slowly down to the lake&rsquo;s edge to dip his black
muzzle in the water.&nbsp; He turns his rat&rsquo;s face up to
the sky, glancing hurriedly from side to side, his little pig
eyes rolling, the white ring of hairs surrounding his snout
standing like a ruff.&nbsp; He is so fat that his short legs
hardly lift his red-brown breast off the ground, and his bushy
tail drags as he goes.&nbsp; He walks with a rolling waddle, like
a bear.&nbsp; His gray-brown coat is dry and dusty.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of wide-open clam shells lying on the sand
under the water, pearl side up.&nbsp; They are the shape and
almost the size of the soles of a pair of baby&rsquo;s
shoes.&nbsp; <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>When I turned over the skiff, that has lain on the
shore all winter, there was a muskrat&rsquo;s nest under
it.&nbsp; The animal had scooped out a hole in the beach, and a
pile of clam shells showed that he had feasted well.</p>
<p>But though all these other small animals are coming out, I am
forlorn, for Peter, the rabbit, has disappeared!&nbsp; Up and
down the island I have gone, calling him, but he does not come
hopping to my feet.&nbsp; No one will acknowledge having shot
him; indeed, it would be a hard-hearted hunter that would kill so
gentle and so trusting a creature.&nbsp; So either the hounds got
him or he felt the call of the spring and wandered away to the
woods full of fresh green.&nbsp; I prefer to think he did that,
but I miss him cruelly.</p>
<p>Here, as in Kipling&rsquo;s Jungle, spring is the time of new
smells.&nbsp; All winter there were some good smells&mdash;the
odor of far-off forest fires; the fragrance of fresh-cut logs;
the not unpleasing, pungent scent of Blake&rsquo;s cow stable,
that came over the ice to me on the crisp, frosty air, but now
there is a very riot of perfume.&nbsp; The rotting leaves, the
barks of trees, the swamps and even the rocks themselves, give
forth an incense.&nbsp; The poplars <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>and the birches shake out sweetness
from their waving tassels, the new green fringes of the
evergreens are fragrant, soon will come the odors from wild
cherry, basswood, and wild grape in flower, and the scents of the
new ferns, and then I shall go quite wild with delight and shall
long to shout my joy to heaven, as Rufus, the red squirrel, is
doing now.&nbsp; Far out on a birch limb, in the sun, he is
clucking and chirping away, his plumy tail waving, his whole
little tense, rust-colored body jerking as he gives tongue to his
spring ecstasy.</p>
<p>Rufus is not always so harmlessly employed.&nbsp; He and the
ph&oelig;bes wage perpetual war over a nestful of eggs under the
eaves.&nbsp; One or other of the small householders must stand
ever on guard against the red robber that goes like a flash along
the beam.&nbsp; What fluttering of wings, what scampering of tiny
feet, what chattering there is!&nbsp; But the birds will win,
they put the squirrel to flight every time.</p>
<p>Once again I heard a call from Blake&rsquo;s point.&nbsp; This
time it was Mary, out looking for new-born lambs.&nbsp; Her
voice, borne on the wet wind, came clear over the water between
us:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting along?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;Oh, not too bad,&rdquo; I shouted in the
vernacular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think the ice will go out this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I screamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;At this rate it
will last until June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think it.&nbsp; We tried to get
over to Jackson&rsquo;s yesterday, and the middle of the lake was
opening so fast we could not make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the shore every day at noon, and let
you see that I am alive,&rdquo; I promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang out a
white cloth if there&rsquo;s anything really wrong, and
we&rsquo;ll try to get over to you somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went Mary, a lamb in her arms, the ewe bleating at
her heels.</p>
<p>Then came a day of warm rain, followed by a high wind from the
south, that drove the breaking ice before it and piled great
masses of glistening white fragments on all the beaches.&nbsp;
And, sure enough, on the next Sunday, the eleventh, Henry Blake
and Jimmie Dodd came across in a boat, the first I had seen in
the water for four months.</p>
<p>That morning, when I looked out, instead of the solid floor of
ice that I had seen so long, there was a great stretch of dark
and tumbling <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>water, over which two white gulls wheeled and
dipped.&nbsp; For an instant I was startled.&nbsp; I felt as
though the island had somehow slipped its moorings and was being
washed away.&nbsp; Then I realized that the ice was gone and, so
far as I am concerned, gone forever, and that the winter, with
its bitter nights, its long quiet days, its flash of sunlight on
silver surfaces, became as the memory of a dream.</p>
<h2><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is the first wild flower of
the spring?&nbsp; Each of us has his own first flower.&nbsp; It
varies with the locality and the special season.&nbsp; Here it
was the hepatica, that lifted its little faintly blushing face
from the edge of a patch of melting snow.&nbsp; I plucked it,
remembering the words of Old Kate, at Les Rapides: &ldquo;Ef you
pluck yer first flower and kill yer first snake, you&rsquo;ll
prevail over yer enemies for the comin&rsquo; year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not trouble her poor mind by inquiring: &ldquo;What if
your enemy is also plucking his first flower and killing his
first snake.&nbsp; Who, then, would prevail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know of no enemy, but I gathered the hepatica.&nbsp; Whether
I shall kill the snake remains a matter of doubt.&nbsp; If it is
old Josephine, who will soon be sunning herself on a flat rock at
the bathing beach, I will not.&nbsp; That snake has been a friend
of mine too long.</p>
<p>After the hepatica came the dicentra cucularia, or
Dutchman&rsquo;s breeches&mdash;a wide patch of them, nodding
from a shaded ledge of rock, and then the trillium, lifting its
white <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>chalices by thousands through the woods.&nbsp; If Saint
Patrick had known the trillium, I cannot think that he would ever
have chosen the shamrock as his emblem of the Trinity.&nbsp; The
golden-throated flower rises three-petaled from a cup of three
green sepals.&nbsp; Below this is an inch or so of thick, green
stem and below that the leaves, three in a whorl.&nbsp; So three
and three and three says the plant with every part of its
being.</p>
<p>The air is full of the spring songs of birds and the dry whir
of innumerable wings.&nbsp; A colony of gold finches moved in
last night, and they are singing like hundreds of canaries in the
cedars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Konker-ree,&rdquo; call the redwings over in
the meadow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Purity-purity,&rdquo; sings the
bluebird, and &ldquo;Quick-quick-quick,&rdquo; snaps the
flicker.&nbsp; Busy brown sparrows slip through the dry
leaves.&nbsp; On an oak tree the woodpecker is playing his
xylophone, sounding a different note on each branch that he
strikes with his little red hammer.</p>
<p>From the drowned lands come the boom of the frogs and the
rattling signal of the kingfisher, and to-day&mdash;the
seventeenth of April&mdash;I heard the first call of the
returning loons.&nbsp; The water is very still, with schools of
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>pin-long
striped fishes swimming in the sunny shallows.</p>
<p>The leaves came out in a night.&nbsp; One evening there was
only a purple haze over the bare twigs, and the next day the
swollen buds had burst out into a very vehemence of leafage, and
all the woods were green.&nbsp; The fields on the mainland also
turned green that day, and on the island the wild cherry blossoms
opened in drifts of white, that loaded all the branches.</p>
<p>With all this newness out of doors, the thought of fresh foods
possessed me and I started forth on a foraging expedition, to
find out whether the hens had waked to their duty, and whether
the cows were ready to give milk again.&nbsp; Verily I was aweary
of tinned milk, stored eggs, and packed foods of all
varieties.&nbsp; So I took the skiff and started for the
Jacksons&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Jackson farmhouse stands on a high hill, commanding the
lake.&nbsp; From her kitchen door Anna Jackson can see every boat
that passes.&nbsp; Therefore, long before one comes to shore, she
is ready, wearing a frilled tea apron and a welcoming smile, when
the panting visitor comes toiling up the steep slope from the
landing.&nbsp; To-day the winds were contrary <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>and I took
her unaware, by creeping along the shore in the lee, and Anna, in
her work dress, was digging stones out of the garden.</p>
<p>Grandma Jackson was knitting beside the stove in the sunny
kitchen.&nbsp; A peddler, a low voiced, dark-eyed young Jew, sat
in the corner.&nbsp; At my entrance he began unpacking his big
oilcloth-covered case, drawing out aprons, handkerchiefs,
shirtwaists, stockings, until the floor was strewn with its
contents.&nbsp; Every article that one could name seemed stowed
away in that great pack&mdash;enough to have stocked a small
department store.&nbsp; When all had been displayed he began
putting them away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all what I got,&rdquo; he said with a
patient smile.&nbsp; Presently he shouldered his load and walked
away, bending under its weight.&nbsp; We heard him coughing as he
passed through the gate.</p>
<p>These peddlers begin their travels with the spring, being
heralded by the telephones all along the line.&nbsp; It seems
impossible that they should make a living, but I suppose they do,
for, after being shut in for a long winter, few women can resist
buying a ribbon or some lace when it is brought to the very
door.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;That feller won&rsquo;t sleep at Joshua
White&rsquo;s to-night,&rdquo; quoth Grandma Jackson, watching
the stooping figure out of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;All tramps and
peddlers and such like always put up at Joshua&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d give them all a supper and a bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Joshua White died yesterday, and his house was the
&ldquo;wake house&rdquo; now, for they still have wakes in this
country&mdash;when the neighbors gather to condole with the
bereaved, extol the virtues of the deceased, and partake of
supper at midnight, when the whisky and the clay pipes are passed
around.&nbsp; In this case there would be no difficulty about
praising the dead man.&nbsp; Joshua White was a man of good
standing, and wide charity, a good neighbor and a kind
friend.&nbsp; The community mourned his loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joshua was an awful proud man too,&rdquo; said
Grandma.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think that he would ever carry a
handkerchief with a colored border?&nbsp; Well, I guess
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the telephone bell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gran,&rdquo; said Anna, after a moment&rsquo;s
conversation, &ldquo;Mary wants to know the age of Alec&rsquo;s
eldest boy.&nbsp; Can you tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Jackson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>me
see.&nbsp; No, I can&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; Ask Mary
haven&rsquo;t they got some old horse or cow that they can reckon
by?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always some old critter on every farm
that they counts the young ones&rsquo; ages by.&nbsp;
Alec&rsquo;s Charley was born the spring they bought old
Nance.&nbsp; They must know how old she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the three Jackson children came in from school, with
their bags of books and little tin dinner pails.&nbsp; There was
no running or shouting; they sat down quietly at table.&nbsp;
Six-year-old Beryl&rsquo;s small face was pale and grave.&nbsp;
She had started that morning at seven o&rsquo;clock, had walked
four miles to school, had sat all day on a hard bench with her
little feet dangling.&nbsp; At noon she had eaten her dinner of
cold potatoes, &ldquo;bread and jell,&rdquo; cake and pie, and at
four o&rsquo;clock she had started home again, trudging those
four long, muddy miles to a put-away supper.&nbsp; No wonder she
looked subdued.&nbsp; She was tired in mind and in her frail,
small body, but she is getting an education.&nbsp; Beryl is at
the head of her class.&nbsp; She tells you this with a little
grown-up air.</p>
<p>It seems a topsy-turvey thing, this way of keeping schools
open during the winter, when only the children living close to
the schoolhouses <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>can reach them through the snowdrifts and the mud, and
closing them in summer when the roads are good.&nbsp; I should
turn things the other way round, and give the long holiday in
winter; but I am told that my plan would never do.&nbsp; The
farmers need the children.&nbsp; So in the rural districts the
weeks spent at lessons are few.&nbsp; It is only in the spring
and fall that the children can go to school and there is no such
thing as &ldquo;regular attendance,&rdquo; that bugbear of public
instruction.</p>
<p>After all, I fancy that the youngsters learn as much while
they toss the hay in the clean, hot meadows, or when they drive
the cattle along the shady roads to the lakes, as they would if
penned in the little one-room houses, where some
eighteen-year-old girl, just from high school, struggles with the
work of all the grades at once.</p>
<p>This thing of getting an education is a mighty matter in
Canada.&nbsp; The roads are dotted with schoolhouses, the papers
have long columns of advertisements for teachers, and it is
always specified as to whether Catholic or Protestant is
needed.&nbsp; It seems the dear ambition of each family to
produce at least one teacher, and the Normal School at <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Queensport
turns them out by the score.&nbsp; On Monday mornings and Friday
afternoons vehicles of every description travel to and from town,
taking the girls home for Sundays and back for the week&rsquo;s
work.</p>
<p>Students hire a room in Queensport for two dollars a month,
and with it goes the privilege of cooking on the family stove and
sitting in a warm room to study.&nbsp; Those who live near enough
to town bring their food from home, so food costs them
nothing.&nbsp; Thus they work their difficult way through to the
little country schools.</p>
<p>My neighbor, Mrs. Spellman, is doubly proud, for her two
daughters are teaching, one in Alberta, the other in far-away
British Columbia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard work to give them their training,&rdquo;
she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their father had no patience with the
notion of sending them to high school, so he wouldn&rsquo;t
help.&nbsp; But I made up my mind that they should have their
chance.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d not be tied down to a farm all their
days, as I&rsquo;ve been.&nbsp; Mary, my eldest, was always such
a home girl too.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t hear of leaving me
until I promised that she should come home every week.&nbsp;
There wasn&rsquo;t <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>anyone to drive her to town and back but me, but I seen
to it that she got home.&nbsp; Every Friday noon I&rsquo;d
harness up and go for her, coming back long after dark.&nbsp;
Every Monday morning I&rsquo;d be up before day, to feed the
horse and cook breakfast in time to take her back to school
again, and she never was late.&nbsp; I always had her there by
nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Sometimes the roads were so dark that
I&rsquo;d drive all the way with the reins in my two hands.&nbsp;
I was afraid to hold them in the one hand lest I should get them
crossed in the darkness and pull the horse out of the road and
into the drifts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d feel sometimes as though my
hands was frozen.&nbsp; But I never missed a week all those two
long years.&nbsp; When Nellie, my second girl, went, it
wasn&rsquo;t so hard for me.&nbsp; The two stayed in Queensport
together, and they didn&rsquo;t get so homesick.&nbsp; Yes, it
was a hard pull, but I&rsquo;d do it all over again, for my
children did well.&nbsp; They stood at the head of their
class.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud of them when they come home,
summers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have often wondered at these little schoolma&rsquo;ams, with
their youth, their high spirits, and their wholly innocent love
of pretty clothes and beaux and good times.&nbsp; They have <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>to board at
one house and another, accustoming themselves to all sorts of
food, all kinds of families.&nbsp; They must toil through rough
weather to their work.&nbsp; They must learn to please all
parents, to conciliate school boards and supervisors.&nbsp; They
must have sense to steer a difficult way through neighborhood
prejudice and to avoid giving rise to gossip.&nbsp; A task for a
strong woman, it has always seemed to me, but I wonder no longer
that so many succeed in it, since I know something of the
strength of the mothers who stand behind them.</p>
<h2><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mudcat season has come.&nbsp;
After the winter&rsquo;s diet of salt herring, and before the
open season for bass and pickerel, comes the mudcat, alias
bullhead, to give us the taste of fresh fish again.&nbsp; From
April fifteenth until the fifteenth of May is the closed season
for pickerel, and from April fifteenth to June fifteenth it is
forbidden to fish for bass, so now the humble mudcat comes to his
own.</p>
<p>Over on the Drapeaus&rsquo; shore the men are all skinning
bullheads for market.&nbsp; They have rigged up a machine that
twists off the heads and strips off the skins at one turn of a
handle.&nbsp; Andy Drapeau dips the fish out of the live box,
Black Jack skins and beheads them, George Drapeau rakes away the
offal, Harry Spriggins and Lewis Drapeau pack the fish in
barrels.&nbsp; The whole shore reeks of them, the beach is red
with their gore, for your bullhead is a very bloody fish.&nbsp;
He is an ugly creature&mdash;great head, thorny spines,
wicked-looking mouth, but he tastes very good indeed, if one has
not seen Black Jack skin him.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>I
have come in for the usual present, and have to restrain my
friends, or they would give me at least a half barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kin you git their inside out, ef I take the hide offen
them?&rdquo; asks Black Jack.&nbsp; And I assure him that for the
sake of fresh fish I can do anything.</p>
<p>John Beaulac was not there.&nbsp; The Beaulac baby&mdash;my
godson&mdash;was &ldquo;awful sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the day came young Louis to the island to ask for the
loan of some alcohol.&nbsp; The doctor had seen the child, by
chance, as he was passing through the farm on his way to the
lake, and had prescribed a warm bath and an alcohol rub.&nbsp;
Young Louis&rsquo; eyes were big with horror.&nbsp; To wash a
sick child was evidently the same thing as killing it
outright.&nbsp; I supplied the alcohol and, gathering up clean
sheets, soft towels, a new washcloth and talcum powder, took
shipping for Loon Lake.</p>
<p>Rose Beaulac sat in the center of a red-hot room, the window
shut, the door shut, every chair, box and square foot of floor
space occupied by a child or a dog, and held the gasping, moaning
baby, despair in her face.&nbsp; One look at its crimson cheeks
and glazed blue <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>eyes told me that it was an ill child indeed.&nbsp; My
thermometer showed a temperature of a hundred and four when it
came out from the burning little armpit.</p>
<p>John stood beside the woodpile and called me as I left the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the baby very ill?&nbsp; Ought he to send for the
doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to both questions.</p>
<p>Then John did some figuring in his mind.&nbsp; His beady black
eyes stopped twinkling, his face grew stern and set.&nbsp; This
has been a hard winter for Jack.&nbsp; The war stopped the export
of mica and the mines have been shut down.&nbsp; Last year was a
wet season when the hay floated in the meadows and the grain
sprouted in the stooks.&nbsp; It has been almost impossible to
make ends meet, but if the child needed the doctor&mdash;well, he
must be called and he&rsquo;d be paid somehow.&nbsp; John left
the decision to me.&nbsp; I must call the doctor if I thought
best.</p>
<p>So away up the lake, three miles to the telephone, I rowed,
and the doctor promised to come the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell John to have a boat at Henderson&rsquo;s landing
for me, at seven-thirty.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make the fifteen
miles there and back over these <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>roads to-night.&nbsp; Meanwhile keep
up the bathing and the alcohol rubs, and tell Rose to keep that
door open.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget that.&nbsp; Tell her that
child must have plenty of air&rdquo;&mdash;an injunction that Dr.
LeBaron did not in the least expect to have obeyed when he gave
it; it was merely a part of his general course of education.</p>
<p>How did those eight people manage to breathe in that stifling
room; how could that ill child survive in that foul
atmosphere?&nbsp; I wondered, as I laid my weary body down on my
clean, cool bed.&nbsp; And if I were worn out, what must Rose be,
who had sat for three nights with that tossing, suffering baby in
her arms?</p>
<p>Whether the lake is more beautiful in the early morning or at
sunset, I have never been able to determine.&nbsp; At six
o&rsquo;clock, as I pushed off from the dock on the blue water,
the thrasher&rsquo;s liquid song followed the rhythm of the
oars.&nbsp; Out on the open bay the swallows wheeled and dipped
all round the boat, so near that I could have touched their
burnished blue-green backs.&nbsp; On the beaches the sandpipers
ran tipping up and down, their plaintive piping mingling with the
robin&rsquo;s <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>song.&nbsp; A gentle breeze roughened the water and
every little ripple that hurried to the shore was tipped with a
winking star.</p>
<p>At Beaulac&rsquo;s all was in readiness for the doctor.&nbsp;
Rose&rsquo;s eyes were glazed with sleeplessness, her face lined
with fatigue; but she had found strength to comb and braid her
dark hair, the children&rsquo;s faces had been washed, and the
baby had been dressed in a little new pink cotton frock.&nbsp;
There was a dishpan full of newly hatched turkeys behind the
stove, for even if one&rsquo;s child is dying one must try to
save the fowl, and there was a basket of young kittens under the
bed.&nbsp; But Richard, the pet lamb, had been banished to the
meadow and the hounds were tied to the fence.&nbsp; John had gone
for the doctor.&nbsp; Mary was alone with the ill child.&nbsp;
She had done all she could, she could only wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you got me his picture,&rdquo; she said
with a piteous little smile and looking over at a kodak print of
the baby that we had taken some weeks before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never been nowheres to have his picture
took.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll be glad of that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far out on the shining bay we saw the boat returning.&nbsp;
There was only one figure in it.&nbsp; <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>John was
coming back alone.&nbsp; The doctor had been stopped by an
accident case; he could not come until evening.&nbsp;
Rose&rsquo;s lips trembled, but she made no complaint.&nbsp; What
was the life of one baby when there were so many, so many that
needed the doctor?</p>
<p>Back to the island for my midday meal, back to Loon Bay to
meet the doctor.&nbsp; This time there were two figures black
against the evening sky.&nbsp; John was rowing with quick jerks
of the short, straight oars.&nbsp; In the stern sat a bulky shape
digging away with a paddle.&nbsp; Under its weight the upward
pointing bow waved from side to side.&nbsp; Over the gunwale
amidship came a steady stream of water.&nbsp; Mrs. LeBaron, the
doctor&rsquo;s wife, crouched on the bottom, was bailing away for
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gol!&rdquo; said John, in an aside to me, as the
party climbed the hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;By gol! but the doctor iss a
heavy man.&nbsp; I thought she was over two, three
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, the method of these country doctors!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no talk of &ldquo;Call me in the night if the change should
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; No promise: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you the
first thing in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, Dr. LeBaron only
gave his verdict.&nbsp; The baby had pneumonia.&nbsp; The right
lung was suffused.&nbsp; He <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>was a very ill child, but he might
pull through&mdash;no one could tell.&nbsp; And all the time the
doctor&rsquo;s deft hands were making up powders, counting
tablets, measuring drops.&nbsp; On every package he wrote the day
and the hour the dose was to be given.&nbsp; He set down the
times for baths and nourishment, he told us what symptoms we
might expect.&nbsp; He gave his directions over and over again,
slowly, clearly, waiting for a repetition of his words.&nbsp;
There was no haste, no irritation at our ignorance, only infinite
care, infinite patience.&nbsp; Then he ordered out the children,
the young turkeys and the cats, shook hands with the mother,
stepped into the boat and was rowed away.&nbsp; If the child
lived, we would not need him again; if it died, we were to notify
him at once, and twice a day he wished me to telephone him the
baby&rsquo;s temperature, respiration, pulse, and a general
account of the progress of the disease.&nbsp; And then when
excitement was at its height, someone broke my thermometer, the
only one in miles; there was no more taking of
temperatures&mdash;and the child got well!</p>
<p>The last time that Dr. LeBaron came to Many Islands it was to
treat Harry <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Spriggins&rsquo; boy, who had cleft his kneecap
straight through with an ax.&nbsp; There was no fire in the
house.&nbsp; The Doctor had to build one and boil a pan clean
before he could sterilize his instruments.&nbsp; There was no one
willing to help him give an an&aelig;sthetic, so he had to sew up
that wound while the boy sat and watched him do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did the child stand it, Doctor?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was pretty hard on him,&rdquo; answered the
doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told him that I&rsquo;d thrash him within
an inch of his life if he moved&mdash;it was the only
way&mdash;and the poor kid gritted his teeth and swore like a
trooper all the time.&nbsp; But the wound healed perfectly,
almost without a scar, and the joint did not stiffen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be quite surprised to know how little charity
work I do,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, giving me a very direct
look from his keen, gray eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are not many
bad debts on my books.&nbsp; The country people pay remarkably
well, all things considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quick little smile flits over Mrs. LeBaron&rsquo;s face at
his words.&nbsp; I imagine she could tell quite another
tale.&nbsp; Doubtless she knows <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>how much of time and strength and
pity is given for which no money can ever pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call charity, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not, of course, charity to charge Johnny Bagneau ten
dollars for driving twenty miles through the blinding snow; to
sit, through the long night and half the day, beside the bed
where little John makes his delayed entrance into life; to eat a
breakfast of eggs in the shells and a dinner of potatoes in their
jackets, and to stand outdoors in the bitter cold to eat them,
because even the doctor, inured to filth and foul air, cannot eat
in that poor room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the Doctor does not work for charity,&rdquo; the
people tell me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He gits paid for what he
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Younger men come from the hospitals of Toronto and Montreal
and hang out their signs in Queensport for awhile.&nbsp; They get
a percentage of the town cases.&nbsp; They do not &ldquo;go
in&rdquo; for the country practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They young chaps is all very good when there&rsquo;s
nawthin&rsquo; much the matter,&rdquo; says old Mrs.
Drapeau.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when it&rsquo;s anything bad we wants
the old Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that is it.&nbsp; When danger threatens we <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>want the
man we know.&nbsp; He has brought us into the world, he has stood
by us through life&rsquo;s trouble.&nbsp; It is he who must sit
beside us, steadfast amid the gathering shadows, as the soul
starts forth through the darkness of the long trail, to the land
where there shall be no more night.</p>
<p>These country doctors!&nbsp; Up and down the roads they go, by
night and day, through storm and fair weather, treating
everything, operating for anything, nursing, instructing,
overcoming prejudice, performing miracles of healing despite
incredible difficulties.&nbsp; To meet them is to come face to
face with the eternal realities.&nbsp; To hear them talk is to
listen to a tale that cuts down deep into the beating heart of
life.</p>

190</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> May woods are full of color;
the crimson of the young maple sprays, the bronze and yellows of
the new birch and basswood leaves reflecting the tints of
autumn.</p>
<p>The brakes are unclenching their little, woolly brown fists,
the new ferns are uncurling their furry, pale-green
spirals.&nbsp; The dwarf ginseng&rsquo;s leaves carpet the damp
hollows, from their clusters rise innumerable feathery balls of
bloom.&nbsp; The little wild ginseng holds its treasure
safe&mdash;the small, edible tuber hidden far underground.&nbsp;
There is no long-nailed Caliban to dig for it here on the
island.</p>
<p>The trillium flowers are turning pink.&nbsp; After about two
weeks of snowy whiteness they have changed to a beautiful rose
color, and oh, the perfume that comes blown across those
far-stretching beds of trillium!&nbsp; No garden of summer roses
was ever half so sweet.</p>
<p>On the mainland trail, that winds along the shore from
Drapeau&rsquo;s to Foret&rsquo;s, the ground is blue with violets
and yellow with adder&rsquo;s <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>tongue, straw-colored bell wort and
the downy yellow violet.&nbsp; Wild columbine beckons from the
rocky crannies, Bishop&rsquo;s cap and Solomon&rsquo;s seal wave
in the thickets, the wet fence corners are gay with the wine-red
flowers of the wake robin and the tiny white stars of the wild
strawberry dot the meadows.</p>
<p>This is insect time.&nbsp; The air hums with the whirring
wings of the May flies, eel flies, woolly heads, and the great
mosquitoes.&nbsp; They cling in clouds on all the window screens,
they come into the house by hundreds, hanging on my clothes and
tangled in the meshes of my hair.&nbsp; The wild cherry trees are
festooned with the webs of the tent caterpillars and the worms
are spinning down on long threads from thousands of teeming
cocoons.&nbsp; When I walk through the woods I am decorated with
a pair of little, live epaulets.</p>
<p>The treetops are noisy with a convention of bronzed grackles
discussing all sorts of burning questions in their harsh, raucous
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerily, cheerily, cheer-up,&rdquo; begs a robin in a
white pine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you, I see you,&rdquo; warns the meadow lark.</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>&ldquo;We know it, we know it,&rdquo; answer the
vireos.</p>
<p>The sapsucker is back, beating a tattoo on the house
roof.&nbsp; An empty wooden box at the door rings like a war drum
under the blows of his hard bill.&nbsp; On the first morning he
waked me I felt a sentimental pleasure in the sound; it seemed
spring&rsquo;s reveille.&nbsp; On three successive mornings I
heard him with an ever-decreasing joy.&nbsp; On the fourth I
sprang out of bed, dazed with sleep, and, seizing a stick from
the woodpile, I let fly at that diligent fowl, and he dashed away
with a squawk.&nbsp; So low may one&rsquo;s love of nature ebb at
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>To-day, as I was dreaming on the porch, I heard a fat-sounding
&ldquo;plop,&rdquo; and saw a yard-long snake hanging in a crotch
of a poplar, twisting his wicked head and lashing his tail.&nbsp;
Immediately a brilliant redstart flew down and began darting at
the reptile&rsquo;s eyes, screaming and fluttering at a great
rate.&nbsp; The snake had probably gone up the tree for eggs,
only to be driven down by the small, furious householder.&nbsp;
In a moment more he slid down the trunk and disappeared under the
house.</p>
<p>The snakes on the island are harmless, I am <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>assured.&nbsp; Therefore I do not object to this
one&rsquo;s living under the porch, but I hope that he will stay
under it, and that I shall not step into the middle of his coils
some day when he is out sunning himself.&nbsp; The feel of a live
snake under my foot would throw me back some millions of years
and I should become, at once, the prehistoric female, fleeing in
terror from the ancient enemy.</p>
<p>The young rabbits are out, hopping softly down all the
paths.&nbsp; They look so exactly like the small brown plaster
bunnies sold in the shops at Easter that, when something
frightens them and they &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; motionless under a
bush or fern, I can scarcely believe that they are not toys,
after all.&nbsp; Comical little creatures!&nbsp; They eye me with
such solemnity.&nbsp; I often wonder what makes babies and other
young things look so very wise.&nbsp; They seem to know such
weighty secrets, that all the rest of the world has long
forgotten.</p>
<p>The old hares also are coming round the house again.&nbsp; One
ventures so near and drives the others away so fiercely that I
half believe he is little Peter returned to me.</p>
<p>Over at the farms the spring sowing is done&mdash;the wheat,
the barley, and the oats; and <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>in the long twilights, and under the
Planter&rsquo;s Moon, the farmers are putting in the last seed
potatoes.&nbsp; Seed planted at the full of the May moon gives
the heaviest crops, they say.</p>
<p>In the furrows, the big dew worms are working up out of the
wet ground, to be bait for the fish hooks.&nbsp; Here, our object
in fishing being to catch the fish, we use worms, frogs, anything
that fish will bite, leaving flies, spoons, and sportsman devices
to the campers who fish according to science and rule.</p>
<p>Walking along the shore trail yesterday, I came upon Black
Jack Beaulac, sitting on a rock, fishing tackle beside him.&nbsp;
He seemed deep in thought and I wondered what new deviltry he was
hatching there, for Black Jack is the tease and torment of the
countryside.&nbsp; It is he who starts the good stories that go
the rounds of the stores and firesides, and the slower wits fly
before his tongue like chaff before the fan.</p>
<p>If Black Jack&rsquo;s tales on the other men are good, theirs
of his performances are quite as well worth hearing.&nbsp; There
is one of the time when he stole a hogshead of good liquor, and
carried it off single-handed before the <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>wondering
eyes of the &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; encamped at Les Rapides.&nbsp;
It was Black Jack who plunged into the icy waters of the lake to
the rescue of the half breed drowning there, and it was he who
came to the aid of poor, terrified Rebecca North, whose husband
had gone suddenly deranged and was running amuck.&nbsp; The poor
crazy giant has never forgotten the treatment he received at
those great hands.&nbsp; Long after his madness was past he spoke
with awe of Black Jack&rsquo;s powerful grasp.</p>
<p>Again there is the story of the race on the ice of
Henderson&rsquo;s Bay that will never lose its flavor.&nbsp; I
heard it from Uncle Dan Cassidy one wet Sunday afternoon, as we
sat round the Blakes&rsquo; kitchen fire popping corn and capping
stories.&nbsp; Uncle Dan has a brogue as thick as cream and a
voice as smooth as butter.&nbsp; No writer of dialects could ever
reproduce his speech.&nbsp; Translated, the tale runs thus:</p>
<p>There was to be a great race to which anyone having a horse
was welcome.&nbsp; Yankee Jim Branch, a cousin of Black
Jack&rsquo;s, had an old nag, fit for little, which he entered by
way of a joke.&nbsp; Black Jack, being temporarily out of horses,
in consequence of some dealing with the local storekeeper and a
chattel mortgage, <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>was not included in the company.&nbsp; There had long
been a feud between Black Jack and Yankee, so it was considered a
good thing that they were not both to be represented in the
contest.</p>
<p>It was a great occasion.&nbsp; The course was staked out on
the ice with ceremony, little cedar bushes were stuck up to mark
the quarter miles, and there was a flag at the judge&rsquo;s
stand.&nbsp; William Foret held Joe Bogg&rsquo;s big silver stop
watch to mark the time, Andy Drapeau had a stump of pencil and an
old envelope on which to record it and the stakes were as much as
two dollars.</p>
<p>The start was made, all horses had run, and the race, oddly
enough, lay between Bogg&rsquo;s gray and Yankee&rsquo;s old
hack, when&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shot sang out from somewhere, far back on the point, and
Yankee&rsquo;s horse dropped like a stone.&nbsp; His driver was
leaning far out over the wretched creature&rsquo;s back,
belaboring him with a great gad.&nbsp; The halt was so sudden
that away he went, straight on over the horse&rsquo;s head,
landing hard on the ice.&nbsp; Up he jumped raging, and ran back
to the stupified group at the stand.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Is any man in the crowd got his gun?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>Every man was abundantly able to prove that his gun rested
behind the door of his own cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Black Jack in the crowd?&rdquo; inquired Yankee.</p>
<p>He was not, and Yankee was immediately convinced that his
cousin, Black Jack, had fired that shot.</p>
<p>Then in the midst of the excitement Black Jack himself
appeared, striding unconcernedly down the hill.&nbsp; He had been
hidden among the bushes, far back on the point, and, unable to
endure the thought of Yankee&rsquo;s bragging if his horse should
win, had raised his gun and shot the wretched animal, at the very
instant of victory, and when, in Yankee&rsquo;s mind, the two
dollars was as good as spent.</p>
<p>History does not tell what Yankee did to get even.&nbsp;
Probably nothing, for no one in the countryside cares to
interfere with Black Jack.&nbsp; He is known as a man of his
hands and a good person to let alone.</p>
<p>All this and more I remembered when I saw Jack sitting on the
shore.&nbsp; But he was not wearing his usual devil-may-care
swagger <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>and cheerful grin.&nbsp; Instead, his square, dark face
was grim, his great shoulders were bent, his long arms hung
relaxed and his black eyes gazed moodily over the water.&nbsp; He
looked tired and gaunt and gray.&nbsp; Presently he rose heavily
and, without seeing me, strode off to his boat, stepped in and
rowed away and the next I heard of him, he had enlisted and was
off to Valcartier to learn to be a soldier.</p>
<p>Following his example went Little John Beaulac and his son
Louis, to the despair of poor Rose, and later, Charley McDougal
and George Drapeau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the meal ticket with those fellows,&rdquo;
commented Henry Blake.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do they know about this
war?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;ll be
fighting for.&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s the money they&rsquo;re
after.&nbsp; The mines are not working, there&rsquo;s little or
no wood-cutting to be done, and they&rsquo;re up against it for
food.&nbsp; Jack thinks that he&rsquo;ll get a pension for his
woman and a bounty for each one of the kids.&nbsp; The recruiting
sergeants get so much a head for every man they bring in and so,
of course, they promise these poor fellows anything.&nbsp; But
they find out different after they&rsquo;ve enlisted.&nbsp; Black
Jack&rsquo;ll never stick at it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll desert, <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and if he
does they&rsquo;ll never catch him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s here to-day
and fifty miles away across the hills to-morrow.&nbsp; He travels
like a mink, Black Jack does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jack!&nbsp; He will find the restraint of barracks and
drill intolerable, he who has never known any law but his own
will.&nbsp; Will he stand the life?&nbsp; I wonder.</p>

200</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">November&rsquo;s</span> moon is said to be
the Indian&rsquo;s Moon of Magic, but here the June moon is the
wonder moon and &ldquo;the moon of my delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
sails resplendent in a luminous sky, pouring its brightness down
on a lake that gleams like a silver shield.&nbsp; Its beams rain
down through the leaves in a drenching flood of light, to lie in
shining pools on the mossy ground.&nbsp; It illuminates the
hidden nooks of the forest, it makes the stems of the birches
look like slender columns of white marble, and the woods are so
bright that half the flowers forget to shut their eyes, and stay
wide open through the night.&nbsp; Slender, tall irises stand
like ghost flowers in the swamps; the thousand little bells of
the false lily of the valley&mdash;the Canada May
Flower&mdash;swing in the breezes that run along the ground, and
on the low, south point of the island the rushes rattle stiffly
and bow their heads as the wind passes over them.&nbsp; They are
the Equisetum, the Horsetail rush, known to the Pilgrim
housewives as scouring rushes, with which they used to clean
their pots and pans.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Mary
Blake tells me that she has used them and that the flinty, hollow
stems are excellent kettle cleaners.&nbsp; They do not suggest
anything so prosaic here in the white moonlight&mdash;rather they
make me think of small silver spears held upright in the hands of
a fairy troop, the small, green yeomen of the forest, on guard
through the white night.</p>
<p>There is great rushing and scurrying in the underbrush, for
the deer mice, the rabbits, and other small folk of the forest
are awake and active.&nbsp; The birds too are wakeful and chirp
answers chirp from one nest to another all through the night.</p>
<p>This is going to be a good bird year judging from the number
of broken egg shells&mdash;blue, cream, speckled&mdash;that are
cast from the nests to the ground.&nbsp; There is a continuous
sound of faint, wheezing cries, the voices of nestlings, begging
for food.</p>
<p>A pair of robins have plastered their mud nest on a beam of
the porch roof, a red-eyed vireo has hung her birch bark cradle
in a low bush under the kitchen window, some ph&oelig;bes have
built on the lintel of the house door.&nbsp; It seems impossible
that so small a nest can hold so many squirming little bodies as
must belong <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>to all those upstretched, gaping yellow bills.&nbsp;
The parent ph&oelig;bes do not hesitate about telling me in good
round terms just what they think of me when I go too near their
home, but the robins do not scold me, they only go off to a bush
and mourn.&nbsp; The vireo cares not at all for anybody, but sits
tranquil on her eggs and eyes me fearlessly.</p>
<p>I have seen a whippoorwill&rsquo;s nest, a thing, I am told,
that few people ever find.&nbsp; It lies on the ground under the
shelter of cedar poles that serves John Beaulac for a wagon shed,
and is so directly in the path of the horses&rsquo; hoofs that I
wonder it has not been trampled into the mold.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s
small daughter, Sallie May, led me to it, and, as we approached,
a dark, slenderly trailing bird slid away through the underbrush,
leaving her two furry balls of nestlings rolling helplessly on
the dry leaves of their bed.&nbsp; They were about half the size
of young chickens and were covered with thick down of a red clay
color that had so fiery and vital a glow that it made me think of
live coals showing through the ashes.&nbsp; We took one look and
hurried away lest the whippoorwill mother should become
frightened and forsake her nest, and two sweet and <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>plaintive
bird voices be lost from the evening chorus.</p>
<p>At Beaulac&rsquo;s, where I stopped on the homeward way, a
lively discussion was going forward.&nbsp; The Bishop of Ontario
was coming to Sark, for the first time in many years, to hold
service and to confirm, and there was much speculation about who
would join the English Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; to be a Catholic,&rdquo;
announced poor Ishmael, the half-wit, peering out from a dim nook
behind the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tells me the priest kin cure the fits,&rdquo; he
went on, hopefully, &ldquo;but he won&rsquo;t do it fer you
lessen you bees a Catholic, so I&rsquo;m a goin&rsquo; to jine
his church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I favors the Baptists, ef I favors any,&rdquo; observed
Bill Shelly, the frogger.</p>
<p>Whereupon John Beaulac retorted cruelly, that
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d ought to send fer the preacher quick and have
Bill dipped right off the dock, clothes and all,&rdquo; further
explaining that the suggestion was made in view of Bill&rsquo;s
general appearance and his boast that he had not touched water
since early in the previous summer, and then only because he had
&ldquo;fell in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, so far from being offended, took this <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>witticism
in excellent part, joining uproariously in the laugh that
followed it.</p>
<p>For the rest of that week, telephones were busy calling a
congregation.&nbsp; I was invited to drive to church in Mrs.
Swanson&rsquo;s spring wagon, and reached her farm by a devious
route on the great day.&nbsp; I rowed across the half mile that
lies between the island and the nearest point of mainland and
walked the wood trail from Drapeau&rsquo;s to
Foret&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There William&rsquo;s motor boat was waiting
to ferry me across the lake and up Blue Bay to the
Swan-sons&rsquo; landing.</p>
<p>Here also there was a flutter of excitement, for Susie Dove
was going to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Clarence Nutting too had wished to be of the class, but at the
last moment it had been remembered that he had never been
baptized.&nbsp; As baptism must precede confirmation the Rector,
amid the hurry and work of entertaining the Bishop and conveying
him to and from the several churches where there were to be
services, had been diligently striving to come up with Clarence
to baptize him.</p>
<p>But each time he searched for him Clarence was away, either in
a distant field or over in the next township, and so the Rector
never <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>caught him, and when the service commenced poor
Clarence sat humbly at the side of the church with the men, and
could not come forward.</p>
<p>There was no trouble about little Susie.&nbsp; Her case was
entirely clear.&nbsp; Her new dress and white veil were spread
forth on the spare room bed for display and admiration; her hair
was plaited in innumerable tight pigtails as a prelude to
subsequent frizzes.</p>
<p>Susie looked quiet and subdued.&nbsp; There was a frightened
expression in her china-blue eyes.&nbsp; She could eat no dinner,
she could not even taste her pie, and soon she and Mrs. Swanson
retired to dress.&nbsp; On the way to church Susie sat silent,
clutching her new Prayer Book in a moist and trembling
hand.&nbsp; On the homeward drive she confided to me that she had
been very afraid of the Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew my Commandments,&rdquo; she assured me,
&ldquo;but I was not so certain about the creed, and I was
afeared lest the Bishop should ask me some hard
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face then was radiant.&nbsp; The Bishop had been kind and
had asked no one any hard questions, and so this little one had
not been put to confusion.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>The
church at Sark is old and falling to pieces but it looked lovely
that day.&nbsp; Each window sill held a plant in bloom, its tin
can covered with gay, flowered wall paper&mdash;geraniums,
fuchsias, patience plants&mdash;the ornaments of many a
parlor.&nbsp; Each window framed a picture of soft, rolling
meadows, fruit trees in bloom, homesteads nestled in the hollows,
and, over all, stretches of blue sky, flecked with wisps of
floating vapor.&nbsp; In the center of the church sat the group
of ten or a dozen candidates for confirmation.&nbsp; Through the
misty veils their young faces looked out, awed and grave and very
sweet.&nbsp; There had been a great disappointment for little
Mary Spellman, for her veil had not come from town with the
rest.&nbsp; She looked like a gentle little nun, with a square of
plain white muslin laid over her flaxen head.&nbsp; Most of these
girls will not wear bridal dress at their weddings, so
confirmation is the one great occasion in their lives when they
can put on the dignity and the mystery of the veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defend, O Lord, this thy child with thy heavenly
grace&rdquo;&mdash;The words seemed to reach me from a great way
off, repeated each time the Bishop laid his hands on a bowed
head.&nbsp; <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>The Bishop&rsquo;s voice was kind, his tone gentle
when, his sermon finished, he turned from the congregation to
deliver his charge to the class.&nbsp; I do not remember much of
what he said, but I have not forgotten his manner.&nbsp; It
seemed to me, listening, that he must feel a peculiar tenderness
for these little cut-off country parishes.</p>
<p>After service I was led forward to be presented to his
Lordship.&nbsp; He said that he had heard of &ldquo;the lady from
the Southern States who was living alone at Many
Islands.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could not help feeling that the Episcopal
eye regarded me with a certain suspicion, as one not quite right
in her mind&mdash;which supposition was, I fear, confirmed by my
own behavior, for when Mrs. Rector said: &ldquo;My Lord, I wish
to present Miss X. to you,&rdquo; the unaccustomed sound of the
title, and my own total ignorance of the proper mode of
addressing one called &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; gave me a foolish,
flustered manner that must have betrayed me.</p>
<p>We locked the silent church, stripped of its flowers and
white-robed girls, and drove along the tree-shaded roads to the
shore, where the motor boat was waiting.&nbsp; The <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>water was
so still and so clear that we could see every rock and pebble
lying a dozen feet below.&nbsp; We passed over schools of big
fish, bass and pickerel, hanging suspended in a crystal
medium.&nbsp; Between the sheer walls of the Loon Lake Portage
the sun was going down in a lake of gold and the rocks were
purple and red in its glow.</p>
<p>I walked the home trail slowly, lingering in the falling
dusk.&nbsp; The odors of the cedars, hemlocks, and basswoods came
to me mingled with the wet smell from the bogs and the perfume of
the tiny twin trumpets of the partridge vine, twining the damp
moss.&nbsp; I came out of the dimness of the woods to the path
worn along the grass of meadows starred all over with myriads of
misty little globes, the seed heads of the dandelions.&nbsp; I
pushed the row boat off on the quiet water, and drifted while
&ldquo;the moth hour went from the fields.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sky
was bright with the rising moon as I climbed the island
path.&nbsp; There was great scurrying of rabbits in the
underbrush and away in the misty thickets the whippoorwills were
calling.</p>
<h2><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is wild strawberry time in lower
Canada.&nbsp; The fields are carpeted with them and the
fern-covered rocks hold each a little garden where the red
berries hang over the water like rubies in a setting of clustered
leaves.&nbsp; The birds are feasting royally and I walk along the
edges of the meadows, gathering handfuls of the ripe fruit.&nbsp;
No one is at home any more.&nbsp; When I stop at a house the
women have all gone a-berrying.&nbsp; Thousands of quarts go off
to the markets, or are cooked here into jellies and jam, for the
delicacy of the winter is wild strawberry preserve.&nbsp; I had
it every time I went out to tea.&nbsp; Now they give me
strawberry shortcake and, O how good it is!&nbsp; No garden fruit
can compare, in sweetness or perfume, with the little wild berry
of the fields.</p>
<p>Not all my friends go berrying every day, however.&nbsp;
Yesterday I was kneeling on the dock busy washing my clothes,
when a heavily laden motor boat, with a row boat in tow, rounded
the point and headed for the island.&nbsp; In it were Mary Blake,
Mrs. Swanson, Anna Jackson, and Jean Foret.&nbsp; Rose Beaulac
and <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>Granny Drapeau sat in the little boat behind and all
space not filled by women of ample build, was piled high with
pails and baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to spend the day,&rdquo; they hailed
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get scared, we&rsquo;ve brought our
dinners along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner or no dinner, I am glad to see you,&rdquo; I
called back, waving an apron in welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew this would be our last chance to have a visit
with you before the campers come, so we&rsquo;ve come to have a
picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; What a happy, friendly day!&nbsp; These
women&mdash;busy heads of households, women of affairs&mdash;laid
aside their cares, forgot their responsibilities and enjoyed
their party with the simplicity of children.&nbsp; And how good
was the chicken, brought already cooked in a shining pail, and
the cakes and pies in the baskets!&nbsp; Mrs. Swanson had
journeyed in to Sark to buy candy, and all that the store there
boasted was the dear old candy of our childhood, little chocolate
boys and girls and rabbits, sugar hearts with mottoes,
jaw-breakers and pep&rsquo;mint sticks.</p>
<p>We sat long at the big table on the porch.&nbsp; We talked and
talked, or, rather, they talked; I listened, marking the
shrewdness of their <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>deductions, the keenness of their
comment, the kindliness of their judgments.&nbsp; I heard all
about the fine new store at Frontenac and the bargains one and
another had found.&nbsp; They described the magnificence of the
yearly celebration there when the Orangemen walk in
procession.&nbsp; They told me that this year Joey Trueman, the
storekeeper, had not scrupled to set off a whole twenty-three
dollars&rsquo; worth of fireworks by way of advertisement.</p>
<p>We explored the scant five acres of the island, peeping in at
the doors of the little summer sleeping shacks, all swept and
furnished for the campers, and then, in the pleasant languor of
the afternoon, I brought out my stack of photographs and told all
about my homefolk.</p>
<p>For I too have formed the photo-displaying habit of this
neighborhood, a friendly, kindly custom that makes one free at
once of the home and all the family.&nbsp; I have never gone
visiting here without being at once presented with the
album.&nbsp; Many a time has my hostess hurried in from the
kitchen to ask: &ldquo;Has Miss X. seen the pictures
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big, unmercifully true-to-life crayon likenesses of
grandparents stare down from all <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>the parlor walls&mdash;ancestral
portraits.&nbsp; There are photographs of all the brides and
grooms and babies, snapshots of sons fighting &ldquo;somewhere in
France,&rdquo; of daughters gone out to make homes of their own
on the far-off frontier, and there are the faces of those lying
safe under the cedars in the little graveyards close at
home.&nbsp; I have heard the life stories of all, and so it seems
quite natural for me to hand out my pictures too.</p>
<p>As evening drew on and milking time approached, my guests
gathered together pails and baskets and, as we walked single file
along the trail to the dock, I tried to say something of what
lies in my heart about all the kindness they had shown me in the
year gone by, but the lump that rose in my throat choked back the
words.&nbsp; They climbed into their boats, that sank to the
gunwales under their weight, and I watched them away across the
purple water.</p>
<p>My holiday is over.&nbsp; In a very few weeks I must go back
to the city and take up my work&mdash;the same, yet never again
to be the same.&nbsp; Here in the quiet of the woods I am trying
to take stock of all that this year has done for me.</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>It
has given me health.&nbsp; I have forgotten all about jerking
nerves and aching muscles.&nbsp; I sleep all night like a stone;
I eat plain food with relish; I walk and row mile after mile; I
work rejoicing in my strength and glad to be alive.</p>
<p>There has been also the renewing of my mind, for my standards
of values are changed.&nbsp; Things that once were of supreme
importance seem now the veriest trifles.&nbsp; Things that once I
took for granted, believing them the common due of
mankind&mdash;like air and sunshine, warm fires and the kind
faces of friends&mdash;are now the most valuable things in the
world.&nbsp; What I have learned here of the life of birds and
beasts, of insects and trees are the veriest primer facts of
science to the naturalist&mdash;to me they are inestimably
precious, the possessions of my mind, for, like Chicken Little,
&ldquo;I saw them with my eyes, and heard them with my
ears.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I shall carry away a gallery of
mind-pictures to be a solace and refreshment through all the
years to come.</p>
<p>The camp is ready for its owner.&nbsp; I have spent many hours
in cleaning, arranging, replacing, that she may find all as she
left it ten months ago.&nbsp; The island lies neat and fair in <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the
sunshine, reminding me of a good child that has been washed and
dressed and seated on the doorstep to wait for company.&nbsp;
Never have the woods looked so fair to me, or the wide lake,
where the dragonflies are hawking to and fro over the water, so
beautiful.</p>
<p>This is dragonfly season.&nbsp; Millions of them are darting
through the air&mdash;great green and brown ones with a
wing-spread of three to four inches; wee blue ones, like lances
of sapphire light; little inch-long yellow ones, and beautiful,
rusty red.</p>
<p>To-day I spent three hours on the dock watching one make that
wonderful transition from the life amphibious to the life of the
air.&nbsp; Noon came and went, food was forgotten while that
miracle unfolded there before my very eyes.</p>
<p>I was tying the boat, when I saw what looked like a very large
spider, crawling up from the water and out on a board.&nbsp; It
moved with such effort and seemed so weak that I was tempted to
put it out of its pain.&nbsp; But if I have learned nothing else
in all these months in the woods, I have thoroughly learned to
keep hands off the processes of nature.&nbsp; Too often have I
seen my well-meant attempts to <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>help things along end in
disaster.&nbsp; So I gave the creature another glance and
prepared to go about my business, when I noticed a slit in its
humped back, and a head with great, dull beads of eyes pushing
out through the opening.&nbsp; Then I sat down to watch, for I
realized that this was birth and not death.</p>
<p>Very slowly the head emerged and the eyes began to glow like
lamps of emerald light.&nbsp; A shapeless, pulpy body came
working out and two feeble legs pushed forth and began groping
for a firm hold.&nbsp; They fastened on the board and then,
little by little and ever so slowly, the whole insect struggled
out, and lay weak, almost inanimate, beside the empty case that
had held it prisoner so long.</p>
<p>Two crumpled lumps on either side began to unfurl and show as
wings.&nbsp; The long abdomen, curled round and under, like a
snail-shell, began to uncurl and change to brilliant green, while
drops of clear moisture gathered on its enameled sides and
dripped from its tip.&nbsp; The transparent membrane of the
wings, now held stiffly erect, began to show rainbow colors, as
they fanned slowly in the warm air, and, at last, nearly three
hours after the creature had crept out of the water, the great <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>dragon-fly
stood free, beside its cast-off body lying on the dock.&nbsp;
And</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Because the membraned wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wonderful, so wide,<br />
So sun-suffused, were things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like soul and nought beside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain stupendous phrases rose in my mind and kept sounding
through my thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I show you a mystery.&nbsp; We shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it stood, that living jewel, growing every moment more
strong, more exquisite, waiting perhaps for some trumpet call of
its life.&nbsp; Suddenly it stiffened, the great wings shot out
horizontally, and with one joyous, upward bound, away it flashed,
an embodied triumph, out across the shining water, straight up
into the glory of the sun.</p>
<p>When I came to myself I was standing a tiptoe gazing up after
it, my breath was coming in gasps and I heard my own voice
saying: &ldquo;It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. . .
.&nbsp; Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, standing there under those trees, clothed in their new
green and upspringing <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>to the sky, and beside the lake,
where the young ferns troop down to the water&rsquo;s edge,
valiant little armies with banners, there came to me one of those
strange flashes of understanding, that pierce for an instant the
thick dullness of our minds, and give us a glimpse of the meaning
of this life we live in blindness here.</p>
<p>I had seen those woods, all bare and dead, rise triumphant in
a glorious spring.&nbsp; I had seen that lake grow dark and still
and lie icebound through the strange sleep of winter.&nbsp; Its
water now lay rippling in the sun.</p>
<p>Since my coming to Many Islands, one year ago, the Great War
has broken forth, civilization has seemed to die, and the hearts
of half the world have gone down into a grave.</p>
<p>But even to me has come the echo of the Great Voice that spoke
to John, as he stood gazing on a new heaven and new earth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the beginning and the end,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold I make all things new.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
